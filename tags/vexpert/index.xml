      <description>Just a quick post about the vExpert sub-programs that have been announced recently.
In my case, yesterday I received this message:
This means that I’ve been selected to be a vExpert PRO!
Becoming a representative of your country/region and willingness to help others become aware of the vExpert program are the main functions of a vExpert PRO.
So, if you want to become a vExpert, start now and you can probably become one!</description>

      <description>vExpert 2020 applications are open!
From November 25th to January 10th, you can apply to be a vExpert 2020 through many different paths and you must do it if you think you contributed to the VMware community.
What is a vExpert? It’s an award that VMware gives to individuals who have contributed (a lot) to the VMware community.
Only the contributions over the past year are evaluated, therefore, it is a program that requires constant dedication every year by being an evangelist and advocacy of VMware products.</description>
