      <description>Some months missing between my last update!
I must say I have been quite busy with the new position and the massive change that has impacted my previous knowledge but overall, I am pretty happy with it!
Therefore, let&amp;rsquo;s move to the point! So I just want to share some notes of the AZ-400 exam which I recently passed and I hope that can be useful to someone.

      <description>A quick post talking about how to backup and restore a SQL database on Azure using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
First, you will need to install SSMS. You can download it here: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802
Once installed, in order to access the database, you will need the server name where is installed. So, you will have to check the Server name in Azure Portal (you can also do it by Powershell of course):</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
It’s been a while since I wrote something, but I was so busy with other things (University) and I wasn’t able to allocate time to write anything.
Today I’m going to talk about an issue I found on Azure when trying to add new rules to some NSGs.
To create rules in Azure I used this script from TechNet Gallery: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Create-Azure-Network-5f5c5332
Problem I was trying to add some rules in an NSG with the address 193.</description>
