      <title>Veeam – Backup VMs in remote sites</title>

      <description>I was wondering why I haven’t talked about Veeam when I use it almost every day in my job, not only administering backups but doing new implementations.
Recently, I had to implement a design where I need to backup VMs in remote sites but not back up them in a centralized storage, they will be backed up on each remote site storage.
So, by deploying a VM with the Backup proxy service and also use it as the backup repository we can accomplish the goal.</description>

      <description>I am going to share some thoughts and opinions about a recent video from the Cohesity Build Day Live recorded recently with the Build Day Live! team.
Disclosure: This post is sponsored by Cohesity.
First, just let me introduce briefly you what is Cohesity:
Cohesity is a platform focused on managing and consolidating secondary applications and the data. It provides a unified view and access to converge that secondary data, such as system backups and analytics in a simpler way to an IT administrator.</description>
