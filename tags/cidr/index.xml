      <description>Hello everyone!
It’s been a while since I wrote something, but I was so busy with other things (University) and I wasn’t able to allocate time to write anything.
Today I’m going to talk about an issue I found on Azure when trying to add new rules to some NSGs.
To create rules in Azure I used this script from TechNet Gallery: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Create-Azure-Network-5f5c5332
Problem I was trying to add some rules in an NSG with the address 193.</description>
