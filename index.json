Basically, a lot of time should be invested and I miscalculated it by too much. Therefore, this will be probably the first and only post about these series.\n Context In order to practice for the CKA exam, it is recommended to perform the famous Kubernetes The Hard Way by Kelsey Hightower.\nThat guide is one of the best way to create a Kubernetes cluster by installing each component of them separatedly instead of using other tools like Kind, MiniKube, etc. which will create a K8s cluster without dealing about any complexity.\nIn this way, we can learn the componentes involved and how they really interact them.\nAs per writting this blog, the components will be:\n kubernetes v1.21.0 containerd v1.4.4 coredns v1.8.3 cni v0.9.1 etcd v3.4.15  Therefore, the Kubernetes the hard way guide will be my base to perform the Kubernetes cluster creation with all the componenrs or basically saying, I will do the \u0026ldquo;Kubernetes the hard way\u0026rdquo; a bit different :)\nThis is the first part of the series for the Kubernetes the hard way but on-prem. (Now discontinued)\nLocal infrastructure  Note: This post explains how I did it and I can be wrong in some parts, do it in the most comfortable way for you.\n Here is the main point when it differs from the guide, we will do it with virtual machines (a.k.a. VMs) instead of using instances in the cloud, why?\nBecause I don\u0026rsquo;t want to setup a cloud account in GCP which will exceed the limits of the free tier (as it does in the guide) plus other concerns.\nIn this way, I can do it for free (with Virtual Box and with almost any Linux distribution) but it will require you to setup more things from the \u0026ldquo;nodes\u0026rdquo; (VMs) side.\nA quick diagram of what I will have in the PC (3 VMs in the same network):\n\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with the infra We basically need a hypervisor (type 2, as we\u0026rsquo;ll install it in our OS), 3 virtual machines (that will act as our nodes for the K8s cluster) with an operating system, configure them and then the Kubernetes hype can start.\nThe hypervisor As easy as downloading Virtual Box (Oracle VM VirtualBox) and installing it in the flavour you want (I am using Debian 10).\nOperating system for our nodes For the OS, you can use whatever Linux distro you like the most, I am choosing Redhat 8 as months ago it was announced that CentOS 8 will be discontinued in 2022 and I wanted something that is widely used.\n I\u0026rsquo;ll link soon a simple guide to install the OS within a VM and some tips.\n Install the needed tools in your PC Going through my own \u0026ldquo;hard way\u0026rdquo; for Kubernetes, I started directly here since I don\u0026rsquo;t need any SDK.\nSo here is how I did it the \u0026ldquo;Installing the Client Tools\u0026rdquo; part which differs from the version published in GKE.\nAs a reminder I am doing this in my PC with Debian 10 (buster).\nInstalling cfssl and cfssljson  Install CFSSL to provision the PKI infrastructure and generate TLS certificates:  $ sudo curl -s -L -o /bin/cfssl https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl_linux-amd64 $ sudo curl -s -L -o /bin/cfssljson https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssljson_linux-amd64 $ sudo curl -s -L -o /bin/cfssl-certinfo https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl-certinfo_linux-amd64 $ sudo chmod +x /bin/cfssl* $ sudo ls -lah /bin/ | grep cfssl -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 9.9M Aug 12 22:31 cfssl -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 6.3M Aug 12 22:33 cfssl-certinfo -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 2.2M Aug 12 22:31 cfssljson  Verifying that is installed correctly:  $ cfssl version Version: 1.2.0 Revision: dev Runtime: go1.6 $ cfssljson --help Usage of cfssljson: -bare the response from CFSSL is not wrapped in the API standard response -f string JSON input (default \u0026#34;-\u0026#34;) -stdout output the response instead of saving to a file Install kubectl  Install kubectl (command line utility) to interact with the Kubernetes API server.

So I just want to share some notes of the AZ-400 exam which I recently passed and I hope that can be useful to someone.\nCertification details This exam (AZ-400) is the second one of the path to the specific «Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert» certification:\n\nLast month I passed the Azure Administrator Associate exam (AZ-104) so I had the prerequisite already.\nYou can check the objectives measured in detail for the exam here but as a summary, this is what the official documentation states:\nDevelop an instrumentation strategy (5-10%)  Develop a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) strategy (5-10%)  Develop a security and compliance plan (10-15%)  Manage source control (10-15%)  Facilitate communication and collaboration (10-15%)  Define and implement continuous integration (20-25%)  Define and implement a continuous delivery and release management strategy (10-15%)   Notes and resources for the exam  Be sure to try Azure DevOps lab where you'll be able to use Azure DevOps for free and with many guided Hands-on labs (https://github.com/microsoft/azuredevopslabs) → MUST\n   Study the majority of the Azure Products that can be related to any process within a pipeline, therefore, applications, web apps, secrets, repositories, VMs, etc.   Of course, I suggest you read and try Azure DevOps and the many of the integrations that can have with Github (remember that it's owned by MS) within a pipeline.   This includes things like Azure boards, App Configuration, Azure feeds, Key Vault, Artifacts Credential Provider, etc.     Monitoring tools within Azure\u0026#8230;you know, the ones that you already know if you have taken the AZ-104, things like Application Map (within App Insights), Security Center, Data Explorer, App Configuration, Hosted agents, etc.   Knowledge about 3rd party products like Helm, Sonarqube, Terraform, Yeoman, and many other tools that analyze code or vulnerabilities will be helpful.   Git basics is a must, knowing things like (init, Pull, push, commit, add, clone. etc.) but more «advanced» things like (prune, gc, pull \u0026#8211;rebase, stash).   Branching with Git (Main, Develop, Feature, etc) and deployment (Rolling, A/B, canary, blue/green, etc.) strategies will be key to understand as one of the main things used in pipelines.   Software testing as well: Smoke, flaky, unit, acceptance, etc.   Container basics with Docker (Dockerfiles, build/scan images process, etc.), AKS (Install, RBAC, configure), Azure Container instances, etc.    There can be more of course but I think you can get an idea of what can I think it can be useful and probably I missed many things I already know that I haven\u0026rsquo;t studied.\n\n Exam and opinion As for now, there aren\u0026rsquo;t simulations in the exam but be prepared to answer multi-choice, single, hot-area, and drag \u0026amp; drop questions plus case studies.\nThere are about 60 questions in the exam and 150 minutes for non-native speakers (if I am not wrong) so plenty of time to answer each question.\nSome questions are quite specific and not very related to general knowledge or even outdated which I don\u0026rsquo;t like it but that\u0026rsquo;s how certifications work in many cases.\nMost of them are related to Azure, DevOps, and the integration with 3rd party applications so be sure to check them and don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to make a list of third-party applications and the usage of them within different languages.\nI studied for a month or so but I do have a certain experience with Azure and I think a great knowledge of many of the processes, 3rd party tools (Jenkins, Sonarqube, Helm), and strategies used in pipelines within CI/CD. \nBe sure to test and experiment with Azure DevOps as it is obvious that it will appear in the exam 🙂\nConclusion I found it fair but not easy for someone who just got introduced to Azure Dev and has a general knowledge of the «DevOps world» (I hate to say it like this).\nIt requires a bit of experience with many of the Azure products, how are they correlated/integrated within a pipeline and many other tools.\nI hope this can be useful to anyone willing to take this but in my case, I did it so can you!\n\n   ","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2021-06-08-az-400-exam-notes/","summary":"Some months missing between my last update!\nI must say I have been quite busy with the new position and the massive change that has impacted my previous knowledge but overall, I am pretty happy with it!\nTherefore, let\u0026rsquo;s move to the point!

As always, it depends but I am going to talk about the technologies used now and the trend that I can see.\n\nTalking about virtualization For many years, virtual machines have been the way to go to deploy applications within servers. You seize the hardware by running an «OS» (hypervisor) and inside of it, you run your VMs where you can assign virtual resources as you desire.\nThis has been (and it continues) to be the first approach for many new companies as it’s now quite standardized.\nIn my opinion, I think that VMware is the most famous provider by offering their Hypervisor ESXi, which has proved to be the standard for VMs.\nI am not going to dive in on this as you can search for more information on Google (or whatever search engine you like to use).\n Talking a bit about containers It’s known that the most famous container runtime is Docker although Podman seems to be the direct rival (perspective only from my understanding, which is little)\nAlso, the benefits of segmenting your applications on different services (containers) will normally let you escalate, perform, etc. better than running it on VMs\nThe principal benefit of running services in containers is that you have a single OS where each container runs on it. All dependencies for the application you are deploying in the container are «in the OS» and this isolation is managed by the container runtime (Docker in the image that you see below):\n\nIs there a mix? Well\u0026hellip; The main problem I saw the first time when I saw how the container runtime works is, how «isolated» is each container from each other? What about a security breach in the OS?\nAnd then it’s when I found a mix of both worlds (which I really need to dig into it).\nKata Containers, a promising Open Source project where it combines both worlds and trying to deliver the best features from both technologies.\nBy running a dedicated kernel (part of the operating system) you provide isolation from many resource perspectives like network, memory, and I/O for example without the performance disadvantatges that virtual machines have.\nRemoves the necessity of nesting containers in virtual machines (which I do like in some environments to provide the isolation that a container runtime can provide).\nObviously not everything is good and it has some limitations like Networking, Host Resource and more. You can find them here\nSummary We don’t know the future but for sure containers are still a trend for many years.\nYou can see that even VMware embedded Kubernetes (Container orchestrator) in their products.\nSo it will be everything containers, a mix of containers and VMs or something like Kata Containers could be the next thing?\nWe will see, for now, let me research more in this last open-source project and see how it really delivers!\n ","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2020-10-31-applications-future-containerd/","summary":"Well, I’ll be lying if I haven’t heard of containers in the past years although I used them barely at my job (solutions engineer) shouldn’t I consider them more every time to replace the applications where my customers have their servers?\nLike many people that work as sysadmin these days, they are used to work with virtualization, in particular Virtual Machines (VMs), customers still using them (and it will continue) to deploy their applications in an OS which delivers great benefits against the legacy approach of the Baremetal (Mainframe) era.","title":"Is the applications’ future «containe(r)d»?"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s been more than one month since I published something here but I\u0026rsquo;ve been changing quite a lot my focus learning and I changed now from CCNA to DevOps things.\n TL;DR I will be building an automated CI/CD pipeline for my final assignment focusing on tools installed and configured on-premise although there will be cloud services like the front-end.\n Also, I forgot to mention that last month I started the last semester of my Computer Engineering degree that I started back in 2014 (oh my!), and I expect to finish it (if I pass the last «subject») next January 2021!.\nAnd now let\u0026rsquo;s move to the point.\nIn this last semester, I have to deliver the «final assignment» which consists of a project of my own that will be documented and then defended (virtually as per the current circumstances) against university judges.\nIn my case, I finally decided to get into the DevOps world and my assignment is Building a production CI/CD pipeline.\nSome sort of introduction I suppose you\u0026rsquo;re currently aware of the trending topic regarding Containers and Container Orchestrators, in particular (you know them), Docker and Kubernetes.\nThose two are the most used technologies in the DevOps world because they work great in conjunction although there are alternatives that could work as good as them.\nSo regarding DevOps, you probably know is a culture and it follows a set of practices where the software development world and the IT operations are combined in order to speed up and improve the process of application delivery (a.k.a. SDLC).\nContinuing with DevOps, there is a pipeline or process which combines the practices of CI (Continuos Integrity) and CD (Continuous Delivery) and that\u0026rsquo;s the process that I am going to describe and build for my final assignment.\nBut\u0026hellip;why this topic? Good question\u0026hellip;I know almost nothing about that world which is a good approach for many enterprises but not for all of them.\nAnd, the same thing with containers, all the applications shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be always in containers but if you can re-code your app to split it into micro-services to make it better would you do it (That probably means spending large amounts of money)?\nAnyway, why I am choosing this topic?\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s a great opportunity to finally take a look into this area where developers need to push updates to production apps in the faster way possible. We saw that even VMware focused on Kubernetes in their product catalog so maybe you should take a look as well\u0026hellip;\nBut not because VMware did it nevertheless, we are moving to a faster and automated world where everything is becoming more and more automatized. Just deploying containers and building micro-services will make you the coolest guy in the world but in my opinion, knowing the use cases and some tools to provision and automate lots of items will make you smarter.\nI believe that this will help me to gain knowledge in those areas and advance in my career, therefore, I will be sharing all the useful information I researched during the entire project.\nHow? It is known that there many ways to build a CI/CD pipeline and many tools that you can use for each phase but in this project, I will try to start with the «foundation» of the main tools used (Container runtime, Container Orchestrator, Configuration and provision management, etc.).\nAll of them would be hosted in on-premise infrastructure, instead of going to the cloud where there are a lot of tools that integrates many things and will help you to avoid problems and headaches.\nSo basically, I am aiming* to build everything on-premise except the service itself (which will be a web application) that would be hosted in the cloud, in order to achieve a better service in terms of availability, resiliency, etc.\nTherefore,** a mix of on-premise and cloud CI/CD pipeline is the objective** with the main focus on the process and not the code of the application.\nThat doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that the process where the developer has to push code to a repository (CI) will be neglected, in fact, probably some tools for the developer will be cloud-based due to the simplicity that adds but can\u0026rsquo;t ensure that this will be my final approach\n Summary In short, I am aiming to gain knowledge about this new area where developers and operations meet, and «everything» is automated (or at least a great part of it).\nAlthough there are many tools to build a CI/CD pipeline, learning which tools to use on each phase, how and why are chosen will be key in order to understand clearly the whole process from a technical perspective.\nI forgot to mention that, there are other things like IaC (Infrastructure as Code) and Control Version which are handy everywhere but especially in this environment as with code you can have different versions and avoid more errors than provisioning resources manually.\n  ","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2020-10-19-finishing-a-computer-engineering-degree-with-devops-stuff/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s been more than one month since I published something here but I\u0026rsquo;ve been changing quite a lot my focus learning and I changed now from CCNA to DevOps things.\n TL;DR I will be building an automated CI/CD pipeline for my final assignment focusing on tools installed and configured on-premise although there will be cloud services like the front-end.\n Also, I forgot to mention that last month I started the last semester of my Computer Engineering degree that I started back in 2014 (oh my!","title":"Finishing a Computer Engineering degree with DevOps stuff"},{"content":"For some reason, our monitoring alerted that the service “vsphere-ui” from the vCSA it was having some problems randomly.

Check this post from my friend Graham Barker to find out!\n\n Let’s move on!\n Proceed to download the «VMware vCenter Server 7.0.0» ISO file from my.vmware.com   Mount the ISO file and execute the installer.exe file :    \nPrerequisite: We need DNS if we want to deploy vCenter with an FQDN but if you don’t have it or you can’t for any reason, you can trick the installer and put the IP address as the hostname and it will work.\nAnother prerequisite will be to have an ESXi host where we’re going to install our vCenter\nStage 1 – New deployment 1. We will proceed to select install as we are going to perform a fresh install from the scratch of vCenter Server 7.0.\n2. I like that it tells you that External PSC is deprecated! Continue with NEXT.\n3. Just put the details of a vCenter (if you have one) or an ESXi host where you want to deploy this new vCenter. In my case (and probably the most if you’re doing everything from the scratch) I am using a host called «johto.pokemon.jp» to deploy the vCSA.\n Once you press next, accept the certificate warning if you know the fingerprint of the certificate.\n 4. Put the name of the VM and set the root password for the vCSA and continue.\n5. I am going for the Tiny deployment as it is more than enough for my lab environment. In a production environment usually, you will deploy a small one that fits in many small companies (or in your lab if you’re testing it).\n6. Continue by selecting a Datastore and check » Enable Thin Disk Mode» which is usually the best deployment as it doesn’t allocate all the space and is also enabled by default. (Look even my VMFS-5 datastores work well).\n7. Now, let’s configure the network settings. Here my Network you can see a portgroup «Std_mgmt» from my ESXi host. If you have an ESXi host with default portgroups, yours probably is called «VM Network«.\nAbout the FQDN, as I said before (check the Prerequisite section in the beginning) you need to create an A record in your DNS in order to be able to deploy a vCenter with a name.\n If you don’t have DNS because you’re installing vCenter and you don’t have it, you can use the IP address as FQDN and it will work.\n 8. And that’s all for stage 1, here we have a summary saying what is going to do. Be sure to review it:Once you’re ready, press FINISH.\n It will start with Stage 1, which is the deployment of the VM where the vCenter Server resides:\nAfter some minutes, STAGE 1 is completed, which means that the VM where the vCSA resides is deployed but not configured yet.\nStage 2 – Configuration Let’s go to STAGE 2 where the vCSA will be configured. 1. Set an NTP server or let the ESXi host also enable SSH if you want to have access to the vCSA.\n2. Configure the SSO, the default is the «vsphere.local» domain, in my case I created a custom one.\n3. And the last summary after we finish Stage 2 when the vCenter will be fully configured.\n4. After a while (15-20 min.), Stage 2 finished without errors!\n5. Now I access the GUI from the URL provided in the previous screenshot and I see that is working flawlessly!\n\n6.

In this way, you’ll be able to manage a server (Windows) without accessing it.\n\n MMC (Microsoft Management Console) MMC is everywhere, when you open the Event Viewer it is indeed an MMC that has the Snap-in «Event Viewer». Here is how would you do it manually instead of opening the Event Viewer «console»:\n\nYou should try to master the MMC as it provides you the best way to manage different aspects and features from a Windows server (remote or local).\n By typing «mmc» in Run and pressing Enter», an empty console (MMC) will be open.And then, you can add a «snap-in» about any particular feature, service, etc. from Windows. Meaning that with the MMC you have at your disposal a tool to troubleshoot a remote or local server.\nJust go to File \u0026gt; Add/Remove snap-in and here choose what do you want! For this example, I will add the Certificates snap-in in order to check which certificates are installed in my server:\n\nOnce you press Add, it will ask you which account, usually you want to use the computer account because services and features related to the computer nor a user account.\nChoose if you want to manage a local or remote server:\nAnd finally, here is the final screenshot after adding the Certificates snap-in from my computer: Now, imagine if you do the same with the Services snap-in and select Another Computer, you will be able to manage the services from a remote computer by just doing that and without connecting to the server using RDP!\n \u0026gt;Check memory resources (RAM) CMD (command prompt)\n Our «old» friend CMD or command prompt interpreter which works on all versions of Windows Server, no matter which problem you have on your server that you can always run it and it is available on any Windows installation without any requirement.\nThere are some useful commands to manage a remote Windows server. The first command I want to show you is the «tasklist» command, which is the equivalent of the «Task Manager» that you probably know.\nIt can become very handy to check which processes are consuming more memory resources:\n[powershell]tasklist /s  | sort /R /+58[/powershell]\nThe previous command is just for Memory usage (RAM) but it won’t work for CPU so, how can I check which process is consuming more CPU resources? \nCheck the next section!\n\n Check CPU resources (CPU) WMIC (Windows Management Interface Console)\n In order to check the CPU remotely, there isn’t a simple command like «tasklist» with parameters as it is harder to get the stats from the CPU perspective.\nAnyway, this is another command that can be used within CMD, the command is wmic, here you have some examples:\nTo get the CPU usage of the server:\n\n[powershell] wmic cpu get loadpercentage [/powershell]\nOr the processes that are consuming a particular percentage (70% in this example):\n[powershell] wmic path win32_perfformatteddata_perfproc_process where (PercentProcessorTime ^\u0026gt; 70) get Name, Caption, PercentProcessorTime, IDProcess /format:list [/powershell]\nAs you can see in this output, it says «PercentProcessorTime=100», which means that a process (mcshield) consumed 100% of his time when we asked for the processes above 50% of the server.\nSo in this case, the process «mcshield» (which is related to McAfee) is consuming more than 50% of the CPU.\nObviously de «_Total» process mustn’t take into account and it’s in the output because I didn’t want to make it larger (although is a bit large).\nThere is another command (typeperf) which although it can be more powerful (it uses performance counters), the output is a mess (lots of data). I won’t show it here but I wanted to let you know.\n \u0026gt;Alternate access to RDP\n A server can be physical or virtual then, you can probably access the virtual machine using Hyper-V Manager (if you use Hyper-V) or the vSphere Web Client (vSphere) tools in order to gain access to the virtual server.\n\nIf the server is physical, you have probably access to some remote console (iLO, iDRAC, etc.) to access the server and finally be able to log if you need to.\n  I hope these tips helped you or at least make you remember how to do it, see you next time.\n","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2020-02-29-troubleshooting-tips-for-beginners-in-windows-server/","summary":"I was thinking these days what I wish I have known when I started working with Windows servers, some basic (and some not) commands that can help me to troubleshoot servers without requiring additional software.\n\n That’s why this is a post dedicated to people who just started administering servers with Windows Server 20xx-2019 (I expect at least 2008 although it is going end of support the next month) or maybe you’re curious and want to know more about Windows Server administration.","title":"Troubleshooting tips for beginners in Windows Server"},{"content":"Here I will explain a summary of days 1 and 2 (November 4th and 5th) of VMworld Europe 2019 from my perspective.\nSo, the first official day is on Monday (November 4th) where there aren’t many people like the next day (the second day, Tuesday 5th) but anyway there are many activities to do!\n\nThis time I was awarded a blogger pass, hence, I will have the honor to be with other bloggers at VMworld while enjoying some privileges like having a reserved seat in the general session, stay with other bloggers or join some special events.\nThe Community: vCommunity I think that for almost everyone that is involved in the vCommunity, VMworld means vCommunity but why?\nEasy, is the main event where you can meet again your friends, make new ones and have fun with them!

If the topic is a bit interesting for me, it was great to hear about it and even ask the presenter.\nHere you have a picture of me while I was recording my friend Jorge de la Cruz!\nThe legend, the spanish rockstar @jorgedlcruz presenting at #VMTN tech talks!#VMworld #vBrownBag pic.twitter.com/zL7rSKGemy  \u0026mdash; Dan Belmonte (@DanGaiden) November 5, 2019  Enjoying VMworld And here I share with you some events, moments and things that couldn’t be possible without the vCommunity.\nAll these moments are perfect to meet new people, engage with them and have fun!\nvFit Run In the early morning (6:45 AM) we did a run on the first day (November 4th) with some people from the community. It was so nice but at the same time painful to wake up at that time…\n1st #vFit run with these fantastic guys!\nToday, they are the real champions 👌🏼\nTag yourseves please!#vCommunity #VMworld pic.twitter.com/18hyw0M9Um  \u0026mdash; Dan Belmonte (@DanGaiden) November 4, 2019  There was a second run scheduled for November 6th but I couldn’t attend so I assume that it wasn’t done.\nvSoccer So, a run for me in the morning and at night…soccer, no, vSoccer!\nJorge Torres organized a match between friends within the community and it was fantastic. We rent a field and after the match, we had a light dinner with some finger-food, omelets, etc. I absolutely recommend you to join the next one!\nNice turnout tonight for the first #vSoccer @VMworld Europe. pic.twitter.com/fr4dXEXb8s  \u0026mdash; Jorge Torres (@J_Kolkes) November 4, 2019  vStreetfighter Well… this can happen at any hour… Gregg, Ariel and I love Street Fighter so, if you want to play with us at VMworld (or online) just let us know.\nWe have our own hashtag: #vStreetfighter\nWhen are we playing? #vStreetfighter #VMworld@arielsanchezmor @GreggRobertson5 pic.twitter.com/60o7MEX1BY  \u0026mdash; Dan Belmonte (@DanGaiden) November 4, 2019  vBreakfast\n Another amazing event from the vCommunity (organized by Fred Hofer). This is always done on the second day (November 5th) before the general session. There is a special place where we have a great breakfast and if there is a sponsor (Runecast) you will have it for free 🙂\nBut the main point here is, meet new people, talk with them and have a nice breakfast before going to the conference center!\nJust finished a great #vBreakfast with the #community folks, worth getting up early for!

Semester ends.\n February: New semester (about my degree) and many things planned.\n March: Earned a certification (MCSA 2016) and letting my self know more in the local VMUGs. I was awarded as a #vExpert for the first time!\n April: Getting stronger and not feeling more pain in my knees after a long injury (previous year).\n June: I took some university exams (all passed!) and then… time to enjoy the summer! July: Enjoying the time when there is no semester\n August: Lots of sport, going to restaurants and more.\nPlanning what to do in New York. September: I failed an exam which I knew I wasn’t prepared but I got married (eloped) in NY 🙂 October: #BlogtoberTech2019 = 5 blog posts! November: The event VMworld 2019 Europe. Tt was amazing to meet new people, older friends and interact with all of them. Also, I was able to record sessions with the vBrownbag crew.\nI also presented a session at VMworld! December: Nothing to say here, basically, preparing the next year.  Success First, things I did and makes me happy that I achieved or earned:\n Personal: Eloped in New York for just 2 months and 3 weeks ago! Commitment: Continue with my degree by passing all subjects with a good score. Networking: Meet better or new people which made me realize that there are good friends or someone you can chat from time to time. Better writing: Although this year I wrote only 16 posts (I know isn’t too much), I think I write better and I didn’t let quantity overcame the quality.   Failure Obviously not all things went well:\n I wasn’t able to pass the VCAP6.5-DCV Design exam in October, you can check it here. For 4-6 weeks, I gained some weight because of time anxiety. I am procrastinating more than I used to (probably because of anxiety?).   To work on  Procrastination: I tend to procrastinate at home when I have to do university assignments. Also, other personal projects tend to be massively delayed. Organization: I do like to organize what I am going to do every week but maybe I have to put more fun windows and realize that sometimes you need to play games, do nothing and don’t be worried about you could do instead of seizing that time (time anxiety ?)!  Writing, hosting, and more: More blog posts for the next year, host people to record sessions with vBrownbag, and presenting more.\n   And that’s all! This will be the last post of the year (obviously) and although I was aiming to publish another different post that I am working on, I decided and wrote today this quick post in order to let you know that no one is perfect of course and there are bad and good news that people usually don’t talk about.\n  See you!\n","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2019-12-31-2019-review/","summary":"I haven’t thought of doing this kind of review but reading some of them through the internet, it motivated me to do it.\nAlso by submitting to programs like vExpert from VMware, made me realize that I did many things this year that I forgot and were amazing.\n2019 Timeline  January: Going to the gym to get healthier knees and finished exams from the university with good scores.

It’s an award that VMware gives to individuals who have contributed (a lot) to the VMware community.\nOnly the contributions over the past year are evaluated, therefore, it is a program that requires constant dedication every year by being an evangelist and advocacy of VMware products.\nvExpert is not a certification! It’s an award that is given to individuals and not companies so, companies must not claim that title. \nWhy become one? vExperts who participate in the program have access to exclusive benefits. One of the challenges that you will see is, the journey to be and to maintain it. As I will explain later, being active in the community (through different ways) is the key to become one!\n\nAt VMworld there are some exclusive gifts, access and parties that are only accessible to vExperts but, interacting with the community will be always your best gift in my opinion.\n\nHere is a list of some of the benefits:\n Join the private Slack channel (which is quite active!). Permission to use the vExpert certificate and logo on your website, social media, etc. Private forums on communities.vmware.com. Private webinars with VMware partners as well as NFRs. Evaluation licenses (1 year period) for many VMware products for your home lab! Blogger early access program for vSphere and some other products. Your profile will be listed in a public vExpert online directory. Access to vExpert parties and exclusive gifts at both VMworld events. Preferent seating at VMworld Keynotes.  How-to Being a VMware vExpert is not a sprint and it doesn’t consist of making the greatest amount of blog-posts about VMware.\nTo become a VMware vExpert, you must be active in the community: This can be achieved by knowing and replying to people on Twitter, writing blog posts about VMware technologies, reply to the VMTN forums even if you don’t know the exact answer.\nAssisting or presenting to VMUG events is one of the best things you can do, not just to know people, promote yourself and learn new things also because you participate in the community and let yourself know.\nTo apply just do it here and list all the contributions from this year (2019).\nIf you still have doubts, you can reach your local vExpert PRO, which will help you with your submission. I can help you if you need some guidance or need any advice, just reach me on Twitter!\n\nOnce you apply, your submission will be evaluated and once the applications are closed, the vExpert 2020 will be awarded.\nSummary By being part of the community and involving yourself more in evangelizing VMware products through posts, VMUG events/UserCons, VMTN forums, etc. you will have a high chance of being a vExpert.\n\n Ryu And Ken Approve GIF from Ryu GIFs   Remember that in only will count the contributions from the previous year (2019 in this case) so, if you are not one know, don’t worry, apply if you think you contributed enough to the VMware community.\nYou didn’t contribute enough or nothing this year?

Well, if you check the blueprint, you will see a couple of sections and not many objectives. The truth is hidden inside each section, which is huge and covers many aspects.\nCould you pass this exam without being an IT architect? Of course!\nMany did it (not in my case yet) by studying and having a lot of design experience, or also helped doing designs with other peers for example. Also, you can gain all the knowledge of all areas and study your main gaps.\nThe goal is to design VMware solutions to meet specific goals and requirements, ideally, you should have advanced knowledge of storage, network, compute, end-user computing environments and other components.\nYou will have to develop a conceptual design given a set of customer requirements, determining which requirements needed to create a logical design and after that creating a physical design with these items.\n\u0026gt;Technical background As you are aiming for a VMware certification, you must think in all solutions, features, and elements from vSphere.\nHere is a list of the solutions that appear in the Blueprint and are related to VMware of course:\n vSphere   vSAN   SRM   vROps   VVOLs   vCenter Converter\n   Inside each solution, you should know at least the most of the features, functionalities that they offer, dependencies between them and test them (if you can).\nApart from knowing about these technologies related to VMware, there are obviously the core areas that compose a general IT infrastructure: Storage, networking and compute.\nSo, be prepared to dig on each area and know about dependencies between each other and with other solutions.\nAdvanced knowledge is desirable (and you will be tested) on each area would deserve more than post so, I am not going to explain anything right now about it 🙂\n\u0026gt;Aiming for the exam Your main guide must be the blueprint, no matter what other unofficial guides say (although they are very helpful). In the blueprint you will have all the sections and objectives that will be qualified.\nThis exam requires to read a lot (more if your daily job isn’t designing solutions) and not just books to gather information about how to gather requirements from the customer and match them to terminologies like RAMPS or RRAC (I will explain a bit of those later), also all the technical papers that the blueprint mention (+50).\nConceptual, Logical and Physical Design, you will see this a lot and once you understand it, you will see why.\nYou must check all the references (documents) that the blueprint mentions because most of them will appear in the exam.\nSome key points from all the features, elements or products I think will be:\n Dependencies: Know the dependencies between solutions. What do you need to enable vSAN, apart from at least 1 SSD/Flash and 1 SAS/SATA disk? It also requires vCenter and DNS. Advantages and disadvantages: Does SRM perform replication? Is HA better to ensure availability than FT? Which solution can achieve a 5-minute RPO? vSAN Maximums and limitations: vSphere 6.5U1 supports a maximum of 4 PSCs per site, behind an LB. Also a maximum of 10 PSCs per vSphere Domain.\n Upgrade paths: How would you upgrade a vSphere 6.0 environment to 6.5 with external PSC?\n Determine RCAR: Differentiate between requirements, constraints, assumptions, and risks. RAMPS: Build recoverability, availability, manageability, performance, and security into a vSphere Logical Design. Gather and analyze business and application requirements from customer interview data, determine customer priorities for defined objectives and categorize those requirements by infrastructure qualities.\n  In the post, I mentioned to you at the beginning there are some resources which are quite helpful in order to learn and improve your non-tech skills. \nSummary There is so much information to digest if you don’t have a certain level of knowledge in vSphere and the «art» of designing solutions, which could lead you to study a lot of products, methodologies, and features in probably, a great amount of time.\nBut don’t be impatient, it will take you time but, review each section and check the concepts, products or features that you’re not familiar with. \nCheck videos and other unofficial guides that probably will make other fellows from the community.\nThis exam is about theory so, you will be tested as an architect who designs solutions based on customer or application requirements and how to match them to a VMware design.\nIt is difficult to generalize all the things that can appear in past, present, and future VCAP-DCV Design certifications but I tried to give you as much information as I can.\n","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2019-10-31-vcap-dcv-design-exam-notes/","summary":"As the VCAP-DCV Design 2020 certification is going to be released (but the 3V0-624 exam is not scheduled to be retired yet) on Jan 1, 2020.\nRecently I made another post about my experience with this exam where I failed, check it here.\nFor your information, at the moment the 3V0-624 is the current exam code for the VCAP-DCV 6.5 Design certification (Also named VCAP-DCV Design 2019), always check the code for the exam no matter which is the certification name.","title":"VCAP-DCV Design exam notes"},{"content":"Today, I’ll show you how easy is to install, configure Runecast Analyzer (v 3.1.1.0) in your environment and we will review quickly what can we offer this solution.\nRunecast?

In just one month for someone who is daily tasks aren’t about architecture, it can be hard (or not). In my case, this rush was influenced due to leaving on vacation for more than 2 weeks. Then, I decided to give it a try before leaving but, the outcome wasn’t what someone would like!\nLet me share my experience in the exam, some thoughts, resources, and notes that maybe can help you.\nKnow yourself What I want to say in this section is knowing your limitations and experience against the exam. I am not going to do a comparison against the blueprint right now but, check the blueprint and be honest to yourself.\nThis exam is called «Design» and that means having a broad knowledge on many areas (like networking, storage, computing, hardware, etc.), a different mindset than an engineer (the famous «holistic» view that architects have).\nSo, basically, check all the sections in the blueprint and match them against your knowledge. Are there too many gaps? Then, you probably need more experience and a lot of time to study (or both) but definitely, the experience becomes very handy for this exam.\n(I recommend you to check the blueprint from the VCAP6-DCV Design which is quite better than the 6.5 version (in fact, it has the resources split into sections instead of giving you a list of 50+ resources like in the 6.5 version).\nI am not an architect but I did some projects from the scratch (small ones) and participated in others that were normal (I don’t want to say big because it is subjective) as a technical reference so, I had some of the knowledge regarding how to approach a project\nExpect to gather the requirements, find «RRAC» (Requirements, Risks, Assumptions and Constraints) and also I had knowledge in DC architecture, vSphere (obviously) and other products from VMware (this is a VMware exam so don’t expect another thing!).\nStudy Resources There are many resources that you can find on the internet:\n vBrownbag VCAP6-DCD videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2rC-8e38bUXAB-VaBem953POgFDrk-Iw   Blog posts:\n https://thecloudxpert.net/2019/02/vcap6-5-dcv-design-exam-experience/   https://davidstamen.com/2017/12/21/vcap6.5-dcv-design-experience/   http://www.vhersey.com/2017/09/25/some-vcap-6-5-dcv-design-exam-study-notes/   https://www.paluszek.com/wp/2018/06/18/achievement-unlocked-vmware-vcap-6-5-dcv-3v0-624-exam-summary-and-tips/   https://vmninja.wordpress.com/2018/11/09/3v0-624-vcap-6-5-datacenter-virtualization-design-my-exam-experience/   https://www.jeffreykusters.nl/2018/05/22/passed-vcap65-dcv-design-finally-vcdx6/ \u0026lt;p style=\u0026quot;margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;font-size: 16px;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://www.jeffreykusters.nl/2017/08/02/preparing-vcap65-dcv-design/\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;https://www.jeffreykusters.nl/2017/08/02/preparing-vcap65-dcv-design/\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;     The books I read:\n VCAP5-DCD guide IT Architect: Foundation in the Art of Infrastructure Design: A Practical Guide for IT Architects VMware vSphere Design 2nd Edition  Obviously I reviewed all the technical papers from the blueprint and you should too (at least check if you understand the main concept).\nThe exam As theofficial webpage states, there are 60 questions and you have 135 minutes (2 hours and 15 minutes) to complete the exam. This is plenty of time for anyone I think.\nI read other experiences and almost anyone had a lot of time left in the clock before finishing the exam. When I took it, I reviewed the questions and there were almost 30 minutes.\nQuestions can be large so, maybe you want to read it a couple of times or even when you’re answering it.\n   The format of the exam is multiple-choice, matching and drag and drop. That means that all questions won\u0026#8217;t have a single choice solution.  \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Even I had time to finish the exam without looking at the clock too much, I failed with a score of 266 (passing score is 300 like many other VMware exams).

About books. the «vSphere Design 2nd edition» along with the «IT Architect series: Foundation in the art of infrastructure design» will give you a general vision of all concepts that an architect must know.\nCheck the blueprint from the VCAP6-DCV Design as the objectives are the same as the 6.5 version but better explained and with references on each section.\n So, that’s all I wanted to say and I hope that even I didn’t pass in this first attempt, it can help other people willing to take it in the future.\nSometimes you have to fail better before succeed.\n","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2019-10-25-vcap6-5-dcv-design-failed-exam-experience/","summary":"Recently I took the 3V0-624 exam (a.k.a.

And I made a local guide with tips about transport, restaurants, places to go, etc. to ensure you can enjoy more your experience in VMworld.\nGeneral information This event will take place from the 4th (Monday) to 7th (Thursday) of November at Fira Gran Via in Barcelona, Spain.\nVMworld is always an amazing opportunity to learn from all the events that will happen there like the Hands-on Lab, Breakout sessions, General sessions, etc.\nAlso, it is a great way to connect with a lot of people from the community, vendors or other persons that you are interested in.\nPeople are really friendly so, don’t be shy (you can try first on Twitter!) and try to speak to members from the vCommunity. Besides, be sure to meet the vBrownbag team in the VMTN Tech talks area 🙂\n\nIf you are interested in attending this amazing international event and enjoy many other advantages, you can register here.\nSome notes In Spain, tipping is entirely optional and it’s not very common so, it’s up to you if you want to leave a tip in case the service was exceptional or you think it deserves it. \nIn restaurants, shops, etc. the VAT tax is included. Therefore, you don’t have to worry to calculate an extra amount of money. \nAlso, once you pay with credit card (VISA branded cards are the most used here) they will make you enter the PIN code of your credit card (a bit different than the US).\nI know it’s late but, hotels near Fira are nice and a bit expensive. The best zone I think it is near Sants where there are cheaper hotels, nice transport connections, and great ambient.\nThe official language in Barcelona is Spanish but most of the population speak in Catalan. Saying that, don’t worry if you don’t understand some signboards from the street or public places.\nTransportation There are 3 different train services: Renfe (Local Train), TMB (metro/subway/underground) and FGC (Regional Train).\nRenfe and TMB are the most used because they have more combinations than the FGC and also better schedules. So, basically, you will see in this guide mentioning train for Renfe and metro/subway/underground for TMB.\nComing from the airport Once you land at El Prat airport, there are a few ways to go to the city of Barcelona:\n  You can take a taxi (expensive but more convenient for people with less time or when the hotel is located in an isolated area). It will costs between 20-30 € from the Airport to Sants (always depending on the traffic). Put the hand luggage on the taxi trunk costs an additional euro.\nYou can use the app myTaxi to order one. Uber and Cabifiy are not available in Barcelona.\n  By train (Renfe):\n  You can go to the Aeroport (airport) stop of the R2 Nord line (you must go to Terminal 2 to take the train). This line will take you to Sants-Estacio and will be great for people staying near Sants.  This line is less frequent than the next option but it takes less time. Pricing is subjected to zones. In that case, From Aeroport to Sants-Estacio the price for a single ticket will be 4.20 €.  By metro (TMB):  Use the L9 Sud line, this is the Metro (subway/underground) service and can be combined with other lines (like L5 at Collblanc stop for example) within the same ticket. This metro service is more frequent than the train service and it costs 4.60 €. This can be the best option for most people because you can use the same single ticket to go to other places by combining lines.  By bus (Aerobus):   The least recommended option as it will be crowded but it depends on your preferences and where do you want to go.  The Aerobus will take you to «Plaça Catalunya» (Catalunya Plaza) but it costs a bit more than other services (5,90 € at the moment), you can review more information in this link. T-10 card\n If you plan to visit Barcelona, consider buying a T-10 ticket (which includes 10 single tickets or 10 journeys) as it will save you half the price of many single tickets. This T-10 card can be used for many people as you want so, consider it if you are a group.\nT-10 cards are sold by zones (because they have other public services integrated), as you are going to stay in Barcelona, you only need 1 zone. Price for a T-10 1 Zone card is 10.20€, versus buying 10 single tickets (1 zone) will cost 2.20 € x 10 = 22€.\n\nT-10 tickets can be used on any public transport (bus, Metro, Renfe and FGC services) with some exceptions covered here:\n You cannot use the T-10 ticket from the airport on the Metro Line L9 Sud. This means the T10 ticket is not valid at the stops Aeroport T1 or Aeroport T2 on the airport metro link.   The T10 ticket is also not valid on the Aerobus express bus.    Moving inside of Barcelona The Metro (subway/underground) is your best choice whatever you stay in Barcelona if you want a cheaper, frequent and reliable service.\nWith the metro (remember the name) you can travel through lines at the same cost. The main stops to consider will be Fira in L9 Sud, Plaça Espanya in L1/L3 and Sants-Estacio in L5/L3\u0026gt;.\nThe fastest way to VMworld? \u0026gt;The closest stop to the VMworld event is Fira in L9 Sud or the Europa-Fira stop which is another stop from the L9-Sud linethat also combines with another train service (FGC trains) which is a different transport service than the metro and it has different stops.\n\u0026gt; If you stay near Sants, the Sants-Estacio stop in L5 will be your choice. Then, in Sants-Estacio station take the L5 to Collblanc stop and after that, change the line to L9 Sud until you arrive at Fira stop.\n\nYou can see in the following map the VMworld precinct highlighted in yellow and the closest stops (marked in blue): Europa-Fira stop which combines FGC and Metro services and, Fira stop at L9 Sud.\nLast year VMworld provided a free metro card; As I don’t know if it will be the same but if you are aiming to visit Barcelona and visit other places, consider to buy a T-10 travel card (10 single rides) which is multi personal and quite cheaper than buying 10 single tickets.\n\n Events around VMworld\n Fred Hofer has a magnificent post where it summarizes all the events and parties that will happen on these dates, check it here \nI organized the vFit runs, review my post for more detailed information\nIn my case besides the vFit event (Monday and Wednesday morning), I will attend the vSoccer event on Monday night and vBreakfast on Tuesday.\n Outside VMworld (Sightseeing)\n Here is a summary of the places that you could visit if you come to Barcelona:\n \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span \u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;La Sagrada Familia\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span \u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Probably the most iconic building \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;in\u0026lt;span\u0026gt; Barcelona.

Our meet-up will be at the red circle that you can see in the following map: \n\nHere you have a Google Street View just in case you’re not sure if you picked the correct exit: https://bit.ly/30N3o4x\nSo, as said we will have the meet up at the red circle that is in front of one of the Europa-Fira exits.\n Schedules Usually, this is a daily run event but, as I am the one organizing it, I can’t commit to doing a daily run because I have other duties to do at VMworld.\nTherefore I decided to do 2 runs and the time of each meet up is:\nMonday, November 4 \u0026#8211; 06:45 AM CEST  Wednesday, November 6 \u0026#8211; 06:45 AM CEST  On Wednesday many people will be crashed by Tuesday parties however I will be there anyway!\nWhy not Tuesday? I’ll be heading to thevBreakfast event on Tuesday and also on Monday night there is the vSoccer event so, some rest is needed 🙂\nThen, on Tuesday you can rest or even go for a run yourself.\n Route The route goes from Europa-Fira station (where we meet up) to Montjuic (uphill) and then coming back from the other side (downhill) to end at the Europa Fira station.\nThe route is about 5.5 km / 3.41 miles and we will see some streets from «La Marina» district (where VMworld is hosted) and the Montjuïc Park.\nHere you have the route if you want to check it out:\n   Route map for VFit Running EMEA 2019 by Dan Belmonte on plotaroute.com How do I join? Just to know how many people are going to attend, register here on any date: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/vfit-emea-2019-tickets-74746226977 But the main point is to be there at the time specified in the schedules section.\nUse the #vFit to share it with the community!\n\nIf you need more information, just send me a DM on Twitter or commenton this post and I’ll be glad to help you.\nSee you there!\n","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2019-10-04-vfit-at-vmworld-2019-europe/","summary":"Yes!

We will save bandwidth and increase the speed to restore and backup those remote virtual machines by using the local storage on each remote site.\n Scenario The scenario I am talking is the following, a dedicated VM with Windows Server 2016 Standard (a.k.a. W2016 STD) to act as a backup proxy and backup repository and Veeam B\u0026amp;R installed on the main site (the cloud we will say).\nThis is the high level design:\nSo, we are going to back up all the VMs that are hosted in the remote ESXi hosts and also save the backup data in the local storage.\nAs said before, in this way we save bandwidth and gain speed in the backup and restore process in case we need to perform any of it.\nWe will assume that we have a vCenter deployed with Veeam B\u0026amp;R installed. The Veeam B\u0026amp;R has configured the vCenter and then all remote ESXi hosts.\n Implementation The implementation is pretty straightforward, we will have a dedicated VM to be deployed on each remote site and then perform the following high-level steps:\n– As a backup repository, we are going to add a hard disk to the remote VM and use that hard disk as the backup repository for the site. We will seize the capabilities of Windows Server 2016 and use ReFS as the filesystem for the added hard disk.\n– Install a backup proxy service, we just need to deploy the backup proxy service from the Veeam B\u0026amp;R console to the VM that we are using. The backup proxy will be who processes jobs and delivers backup traffic.\nSo, let’s go each step!\n Backup proxy service First, our Windows Guest OS VM is joined to the domain, so we won’t have any kind of problem for resolving the name or accessing with domain account credentials.\nLet’s add the proxy by going to the Backup Infrastructure tab \u0026gt; Backup Proxy \u0026gt; Add VMware Backup Proxy…\nAs this is a new server for Veeam, we will have to add it as a «server» by pressing «Add New…»:\n\nThen, this window will appear, just enter the FQDN of your server:\n\nChoose credentials and choose«Apply «to install the transport service:\n\nAfter that, you will be able to choose the newly added server (Proxy_EUR.itgaiden.com) from the drop-down menu:\n\nNow, let’s configure the Transport mode and Datastores for this proxy (as in the previous screenshot):\n\nAnd for the datastores, choose the ones that are connected to the ESXi host where the VM is hosted by selecting Manual Selection and adding them:\n\nAfter configuring that, you will have the same configuration as in this screenshot:\n\nFinally, just hit Next and apply any kind of traffic rule if you want:\n\nNow, finish, and the proxy will be fully configured and ready.\n  We configured these options because they are the best for our deployment which is using a Windows VM that will have a backup repository which will save the backups.\nFor more detailed options about the Backup Proxy service go here.\nAfter configuring each backup proxy we will have a bunch of them in the Backup Proxies tab:\n\nBackup repository configuration In this step, I suggest following this article to perform this step.\nBasically, we just have to add a new hard disk to our dedicated VM as Thick Provision Eager Zeroed, format the disk as ReFS and finally, add the Backup Repository to the Veeam B\u0026amp;R Console.\nIn that article, it’s also explained the benefits of ReFS so, I think it’s more detailed and easy to follow it.\nAfter we configure all the backup repositories, we will have the same amount as the backup proxies:\n\nAs you can see in the previous screenshot, the path (D:\\Backups) is the disk that we added to the VM on each remote site. We have configured the backup repository to that path because, as explained before, we have a disk formatted in ReFS and it’s explained in the article.\n Backup job configuration After configuring the backup proxy and backup repositories on each site, we are ready to the last step, configuring the backup job to perform backups.\nGo to Home tab and then Backup… Virtual Machine:\n\nNow, step by step, pick a name for the job:\nProceed to select the VMs you want to backup (in our case the ones in the EUR site):\n Let’s continue and in the Backup proxy, click Choose… and select the correspondent backup proxy (EUR_proxy):\n Press OK and go to Advanced. Configure it like that if you want Synthetic full backups: \n And then the monthly health check (recommended):\nAccept and here is the summary for the backup proxy step (we will keep 7 restore points in our case):\n\nConfigure any option as you like (not in my case):\n\nAnd finally, proceed with the schedule that you want after finishing the configuration for this job!\nAnd that would be all for this remote site. We had to to the same with the other remote sites and our job will be done!\n\n Conclusion Finally, with this design you will be able to back up remote sites and store the backups in the local storage from each site.\nIf you don’t want to use a dedicated VM as a backup proxy, you can install the service on a VM that has low usage and install the backup proxy service, however, it’s recommended to use a dedicated VM which will have the backup proxy service and the backup repository (the virtual hard disk attached).\n   ","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/?p=1018/","summary":"I was wondering why I haven’t talked about Veeam when I use it almost every day in my job, not only administering backups but doing new implementations.\nRecently, I had to implement a design where I need to backup VMs in remote sites but not back up them in a centralized storage, they will be backed up on each remote site storage.\nSo, by deploying a VM with the Backup proxy service and also use it as the backup repository we can accomplish the goal.","title":"Veeam – Backup VMs in remote sites"},{"content":"I will explain today how to migrate ADFS from 2012 R2 (3.0 v) to 2016 (4.0) without almost no downtime.

It provides a unified view and access to converge that secondary data, such as system backups and analytics in a simpler way to an IT administrator.\n Now, let’s deep intothe topic.\nIn the video, you will see how Alastair Cooke and Bharath Nagaraj building a Cohesity cluster from the scratch, configuring jobs, updating the physical appliance, restoring some data and showing some other cool stuff.\nI really like this kind of videos because, you can see how they install a cluster, configure it or resolve any problems that can happen in real time without cuts.\nAlso, you can notice how much time it can take to deploy and configure a Cohesity cluster in some minutes, or even upgrading the whole cluster (node by node) while running some protection jobs (backup jobs).\nHardware In this case, they use a physicalunit for deploying their solution, so it’s a 2U enclosure with 4 servers/nodes inside (blade server type). \nIt comes,like most other solutions, with 1GB ports for Management purposes and 10GB ports for Production Data.\nAs this is an HCI solution, it comes with the storage and computesresources necessary to process and store all data (PCIe Flash card and hard drives in each node).\n Cluster configuration and UI To configure the cluster you won’t need a lot of data to fill or knowledge to do it, they configure the cluster easier than I thought and straightforward. \nIn a real scenario, a Cohesity engineer will do it for you thus, this is just to let you know of the simplicity of it.\nThe UI is simple and clean, the home dashboard looks nice with some graphics regarding your Storage Reduction, Health, Throughput, Protection Runs, etc.\nBackup As you probably guess, it backups your vSphere/Hyper-V/Nutanix environment like other products do, so you can configure a Backup Policy with a schedule, time retention, etc. to back upyour data and then you configure a Protection job which will be the backup job that is associated to a policy.\nJust register the hypervisor of your choice and basically, you’re ready to back up your virtual servers (VMs). \nOne option I really liked when registering a hypervisor was, the option of selecting «Auto Cancel Backup if Datastore is running low on space», so the DataPlatform solution is aware of the datastore’s space and can avoid you a big problem there…\n About granularity, there is a lot of options to select when you create a protection job (DB, Virtual/Physical Servers, but regarding what you can see in the video they protected only VMs and Office 365 mailboxes in different backup policies.\nIt’s great that when you are creating a protection job (a.k.a. backup job). you can select an object like a cluster or a folder with some particular VMs and then check the «Autoprotect» option to ensure that new VMs that are added to that object (folder, cluster, etc.) will be automatically protected.\n Regarding long term retentions, you can choose to add an external target like a NAS or any cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) to store your archive backups there.\nThis is an option that adds great value to your strategy because when storing great amounts of data for several years, you usually don’t want to store it locally or even in a NAS.\nIn my opinion, having a flexible option to store it in any cloud can save you a lot of headaches despite the money that you must pay for the cloud service (which nowadays almost every company does).\nSo, within a Backup policy select the Archival option and then you add as many external targets to store your long term backups.\n Restore Your backup strategy is useless unless you can restore from it…\nIdo like some points about this section that makes so simple to restore, from a single file (even download it) to restore tons of virtual machines to your virtual environment.\n– Single file restore If you want to recover a file, you don’t have to search for the date, where it was, etc. As simple as searching for the name of the file (or the portion you remember) and it will be searched in the entire cluster for you:\nAnd then, when you found that file, look at the options that we have:\nFirst, search for the date and then, you can choose the usual option (Recover to Server) or … download it at the moment (a cool option there).\nIt looks like a painless and simpleway to restore files that probably a non-tech person could do.\n– Instant mass restore Now, going bigger, let’s talk about the Cohesity instant mass restore of virtual machines. As the Cohesity platform is designed in a distributed architecture where there isn’t a centralized bottleneck, they can restore tons of VMs quite faster than other products.\nWhen recovering a lot of VMs, in the background (you could look at your vSphere environment) it will mount an NFS datastore and bring up all you requested VMs (quite fast to be honest).\n– Office 365 Finally, the last thing to show you is the option to backup your Office 365 environment. You can integrate Cohesity with your Office 365 and perform protection jobs that will be associated with a policy and consolidate all the data within the same platform.\nUpgrading The process is straightforward, selecting a package from your local computer or getting it from the Internet, this makes it so easy to do it for yourself.\nOne thing that stuckin my mind was that, while there were running some protection jobs you are able to upgrade the whole cluster (node by node) non-disruptively.\nAs the entire solution is designed to tolerate one node failure (N+1 redundancy) thus, you can upgrade one node without disruption in the service.\nAs we said before, the Cohesity platform is based in a distributed architecture so, in case a reboot is required after upgrading one of the nodes, you will only lose the bandwidthcoming from that node and not impacting the rest of the environment.\nHelios Cohesity Helios is the console that lets you manage and view all your clusters from one console. As it’s in the cloud, you only have to register your Cohesity appliance and at the end, it will show up in the Helios console.\nHelios Dashboard is similar to a Cohesity management dashboard but with the ability to manage all your clusters from that single pane of glass.\nAnd it’s just not that… Helios lets you install applications!\nYes, you can choose to install applications in one of your clusters without anything else. What Helios will do is to deploy an app within a container (using Kubernetes) in that cluster without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.\nJust install, configure and run your app (as it sounds).\nFor example, running Splunk to gather data analytics in your clusters without having to worry about to deploy it is really a nice feature to look at it. \nI’ve never seen a feature like that and it really surprised me when I saw it. A nice additional value that you can consider when using Helios with your Cohesity platform.\nOther use cases As the Cohesity platform is cloud and hypervisor agnostic, you can protect objects on any cloud Azure/GCP/AWS or any hypervisor Hyper-V/VMware/Nutanix but, do you imagine what else can you do?\nWell, you can use it to migrate VMs between different environments! It’s a great use case where you can choose to backup all your vSphere environment and move it to Nutanix for example or moving it to Azure. \nObviously, there is work to do after it but, the amount of simplicity that gives you with that, for me, it’s massive.\nThat’s all… We saw a lot of things from the Cohesity platform, how can help your company to achieve that data consolidation by: backing up from different clouds and environments (cloud and hypervisor agnostic) , establishing an SLA in your services (configuring policies), recovering tons of VMs and other features like Helios, a cloud console that brings you a unified view for your Cohesity environment, analytics for all your data and even the ability to deploy applications without needing any kind of resources.\nIf you are interested in more content, check the Cohesity Build Day Live web page or the official web page from Cohesity.\n\n ","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/?p=861/","summary":"I am going to share some thoughts and opinions about a recent video from the Cohesity Build Day Live recorded recently with the Build Day Live! team.\nDisclosure: This post is sponsored by Cohesity.\nFirst, just let me introduce briefly you what is Cohesity:\nCohesity is a platform focused on managing and consolidating secondaryapplications and the data.

What can you see here?\nKeanu Reeves has been linked cloned! In the previous image, you can see 3 different characters but they share something in common…the actor!\n Linked clones are the same! A linked clone is a type of clone (a copy of a virtual machine) where the parent VM shares virtual disks with their clones.\nThe resulting linked clone will be created from the parent’s VM snapshot and because of being a snapshot, it will have the same state that was the snapshot was taken.\nWhen the linked clone is created, it shares his own virtual disk (.vmdk file) with the snapshot from the parent VM, this leads to some unique features:\n The clone will be dependent from the parent VM because they are sharing their virtual disks. If you delete the parent’s VM snapshot, it will corrupt the clone’s virtual disk. Even both VMs are sharing their storage, any changes performed in the clone won’t affect the parent VM and vice-versa. The linked clone will have the exact same data as the source VM because it was created from a snapshot. The save spacings are obvious because the clone will only write the new modifications in its own virtual disk. So, the clone’s virtual disk size will be only the amount of data that changed after it was created!   General process\n  Use or prepare a VM (Parent VM) that will be used as a master/parent to deploy the linked clones Power-off the Parent VM (Recommended but not mandatory) Perform a snapshot of the VM.

(Extra plus) If you decide to keep the linked clone for any reason, you can perform a full clone of it and it will become an independent VM!   In the next section, I will show you how to create a linked clone with PowerCLI from a Windows VM and in my case, I will use Custom Specifications within the script to launch the clone.\n\n Lab time!\n Here we have the VM that we’re going to use as our Parent VM:\n– Name: SQLMasterVM\n– IP: 192.168.1.174\n– Disk allocation: Around 35 GB summing both disks.\n– Domain: vmug.bcn\nInside the Guest OS:\n Space allocated in DS:\n\n What are we going to do?\n Shutdown the master image VM that hosts some DBs. Create a snapshot when the VM is powered-off to ensure that is consistent (this is a VM with a SQL installed so, even more recommended) Perform the linked-clone via PowerCLI. Start the VM (We aren’t going to do the extra step of creating a snapshot of the clone) and use custom specifications to fully customize the clone.  All of this will be performed by this simple script:\n  [powershell]\n##Creating SQL Linked Clone from a Parent VM \"SQLMasterVM\"\n#variables\n$OSSpec = Get-OSCustomizationSpec -Name \u0026#8216;Win-SQL\u0026#8217;\n$BaseVM = \"SQLMasterVM\"\n$LinkedVM = \"SQL-LC1\"  # Delete snapshots on the Parent VM\nGet-Snapshot -VM $BaseVM | Remove-Snapshot -Confirm:$falseStart-Sleep -Seconds 2  #Create snapshot\nNew-Snapshot -VM $BaseVM -Name \"Linked-Snapshot\" -Description \"Snapshot for linked clones for $LinkedVM\"  #Gather information of the created snapshot\n$snapshotParent = Get-Snapshot -VM $BaseVM | Select Name\n$snapshotParent = $snapshotParent.Name\nStart-Sleep -Seconds 5  #Create Linked Clone referencing snapshot and start the VM.\nNew-VM -Name $LinkedVM -VM $BaseVM -Datastore \"VMS\" -ResourcePool (Get-Cluster -Name Gaiden-Cluster | Get-ResourcePool) -OSCustomizationSpec $OSSpec -LinkedClone -ReferenceSnapshot $snapshotParent -DiskStorageFormat Thin\nStart-VM -VM $LinkedVM\n[/powershell]  In this script, I am also using the OSCustomizationSpec parameter, while using the sentence to create the linked clone, to change the IP, name and join again to the domain the resultant clone. Also, I am changing the SQL instance name in my case because it’s a server with MSSQL server installed.\nOnce the script finished, a new linked clone is created and powered on with the name «SQL-LC1».\n We can see the amount of time that takes to create a Linked clone (5 seconds):\nAnd now look at the storage allocated by the Linked clone (powered off), 750 MB approximately:\n\n After the Linked clone is created and powered on, you can do whatever you want. \nI had to wait some minutes (around 10 min. in my case) until the OS customization specification finish all the actions specified (power on the VM, join to the domain, reboot the VM, execute a script to update SQL instance, etc.)\nHere is the «real» space allocated after the Linked clone has booted up and I logged in with a user, around 4 GB:\n\n A look inside the Guest OS of the linked clone (new hostname, IP and has the same storage as the Parent VM:\n\n Use cases It’s commonly used in VDI and DEV environments but here are some examples:\n Desktop Deployment\n QA Bug testing DB server testing File server testing General testing   Benefits and limits\n Let’s summarize which are the benefits and limits that we can find in linked clones:\n\nPros\n Superfast cloning compared to a Full/Normal clone, it takes seconds instead of minutes to clone large VMs.\n Space savings due to changes are stored in a separate disk (clone’s flat disk). Useful for development environments or if you want to keep the clone just, perform a full clone of it! Deploy as many linked clones as you want, they will reference the snapshot in the Parent VM hence, there is no disk chain on that (except for the snapshot you created of course) and the benefits of replicating. Ongoing changes made in the virtual disk of the source VM don’t affect the linked clones and changes to the disk of the linked don’t affect the parent. It can be performed with the parent VM powered on but, it will have some performance degradation and probably inconsistent data (if for example, the parent VM hosts a DB).  Cons\n Recommended but not mandatory that the parent VM has to be powered off. There is a storage/disk dependency as the linked clone is created from the parent’s VMsnapshot then, if you delete that snapshot, inconsistencieswill occur in the clone (and at the end you will delete it). Performance on the destination clone will be impacted (as virtual machines are sharing storage)    To conclude Linked clones have multiple benefits compared to full clones and it has many use cases as we saw before.\nYou can easily replicate the status of a VM (snapshot) and deploy linked clones to your end-users with all the benefits as for example space savings or the deployment speed. \nTo end this series, we will look at instant clones, another type of clone that is even faster than linked clones but, with some particularities.\n","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2019-04-16-cloning-virtual-machines-in-vsphere-series-part-3-linked-clones/","summary":"Let’s start with part 3 in the cloning virtual machines in vSphere series, I am going to talk about another type of clones, linked clones!\n\n All articles regarding cloning virtual machines in vSphere series:\nPart 1: Types of clone\nPart 2: Full Clone\nPart 4: Instant Clones (not published yet) As said in previous articles, this series is only focused on VMware vSphere hence, VMware Horizon View is not contemplated (Linked clones are commonly used in that product).","title":"Cloning virtual machines in vSphere series – Part 3: Linked Clones"},{"content":"Hey!

As you probably know a full clone is an exact copy of a source VM, meaning that, everything from the parent VM is copied (VM settings, disks, files, etc.).\nThis action can be performed if the parent VM is powered off or powered on and, if it has snapshots it will consolidate them once the clone is done.\nWhen you clone a VM be aware that, all data will be identical so, if you power on the clone without performing any customization, probably you will have conflicts with IPs, MAC addresses, SIDs (Windows), etc.\nThe great thing about a full clone is that, after the cloning operations are performed the clone will be an independent copy of a virtual machine that doesn’t share anything with the parent virtual machine (we are talking about from a computeand storage perspective within vSphere).\nWays to do it First of all, you will need VMware vCenter to do it. \nThere are other ways (not official) like copying all data related to the virtual machine (.vmdk and .vmx files) and then register the «new» VM with another name.\nLet’s continue with the usual ways:\nvSphere Web Client You can do it through vSphere Web Client, as simple as, right-click a VM -\u0026gt; «Clone to Virtual Machine…» :\nOnce it finishes, it takes some time (depends on the storage that the source VM has allocated) but in the end, you will have your new clone.\nLikely you are more familiar about deploying templates…\nDeploying a template is the same as cloning but. aside from copying the same data from the parent virtual machine, vSphere lets you customize the deployed VM for creating many clones and with different configurations as you wish.\nPowerCLI Of course, you can do it with PowerCLI. These are the minimal parameters needed to perform it (Disk Storage Format parameter is optional but recommended because, by default, it will convert all disks to Thick Provision Eager Zeroed):New-VM -Name  -VMHost  -VM  [-DiskStorageFormat ]\nIn the previous screenshot, you can see the minimum parameters required to perform a full clone, if you want to see more options you can check it here.\nAs you can see in the code, it’s similar to deploying a template, isn’t it?\nUse cases The main use case is deploying from a template, maybe we are not aware but, deploying from a template is just cloning our source VM (Master template) and then customizing it.\nI saw many customers use it as a «rollback» when they have to perform a destructive task within the Guest OS. In this way, just shutting down the parent VM and powering on the clone.\nIf you think a snapshot can do the same as a clone well, not always… some applications don’t handle well doing a quiesced snapshot.\nThis is why, as a solution, you can create a full clone when the virtual machine is powered off and then, have a copy that will be consistent and without corruption.\nAnother use case could be to perform a full clone to use it in other environments. Although there are better ways to do this (with other products), when the Guest OS has many customizations, this can be an alternative solution of re-creating the entire virtual machine.\nBenefits and limitations\n The benefits of a full clone were mentioned before: \n If the cloning operation is executed when the source VM is powered off, it can be used as a rollback in many cases (there are better options like a VM backup but, it can help a lot). Creation of an independent VM that shares nothing with the source VM.  Used in templates, so, they are very useful!  These are some limitations instead of disadvantages that we can find:\n It takes some time to create a full clone (it depends on the allocated storage) as it has to copy all storage from the source VM. It can only be performed with VMware vCenter (there are other ways as I explained before but they are not official). If done when the VM is powered on, it has an impact on the source VM that can be noticed by the business so, isn’t the best option to do it while the virtual machine is in running.   Conclusion To sum up, a full clone is a great way to have an identical copy of another VM to use it as a permanent virtual machine once you configure it accordingly.\nAs said before, is the same as deploying a template because you are just cloning a VM (deploying a template) and then customizing it. \nIt usually takes some minutes to finish the clone (depending on the storage allocated in the parent VM), this is why there are other ways to deploy clones in a faster way (on the next posts!).\n","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2019-03-06-cloning-virtual-machines-in-vsphere-part-2-full-clone/","summary":"Continuing with the cloning virtual machines in vSphere series, today I am going to write about the full clone, how it works and some useful information about it.\n\nSo, let’s talk about clones… but just full clones.\nHow does it work?

As this is a full copy of the VM (it will copy the entire disk), this might take several minutes depending on the size of the VM.\n\nAfter you perform it, remember that everything will be the same then, all configuration (SID, network configuration, hostname, etc.) within the VM will be identical hance, it can lead to problems if both VMs co-exist at the same time without the proper configuration.\nFull clone  Linked clone Is a clonemade from a snapshot of the Parent VM. This means that both VMs (the Linked clone and the parent VM) have in common virtual disks. \nSo, the linked clone is dependent on the parent VM, meaning that the linked clone needs access to the parent VM. The clone must be done while the Parent VM is powered off (as a best practice).\n\nOnce a linked clone is performed, changes on the parent VM doesn’t affect the linked clone and in the other way, changes in the linked clone don’t affect the original VM. Mainly the benefits of using linked clones are: \n Saving disk space because only the differences between the origin snapshot and the linked clone are allocated and the fast.   Quickly deploy tens or hundreds of VMs in a fast way as it doesn\u0026#8217;t need to copy the entire disk.   This is a technology commonly used in VMware Horizon View to provide desktop deployment (rapidly deploy a lot of VMs). The thing is that we can also use it with PowerCLI without having Horizon View and use it for more use cases.\nLinked clone  Instant clone Similar to the linked clone, Instant Clone is like an improved version of linked clone technology. This is something «new» in vSphere 6.7 as is available through the API.\n\nLike the linked clone technology, there is a parent VM which will share the disk with the clone (Instant clone) but, in this case, it will share the memory too (even if TPS is disabled).\nThere are two types of Instant Clones that I will explain in more detail in the next posts but, as a summary, you can do an instant clone from a source VM from a point in time and deliver many VMs (instant clones) as you want. \nThe Parent VM must be powered-on instead of powered off like other types of clones, in this way, it can provide even a faster way to deploy VMs because it will not require to power-cycle the Instant Clones.\n\nAs benefits, we will have the same as in Linked Clones technology plus memory efficiency (because it shares memory between VMs) and the ability to resume the VM in a point of time without power cycling the clone. \nIn the other hand, depending on which type of instant clone you can run with a lot of delta disks.\n\nInstant clone So… I tried to summarize each clone’s type that we can perform within vSphere and if you want to read more, stay tuned to go in more detail in the coming series of posts related to cloning VMs within vSphere.\n ","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2019-02-25-cloning-vms-in-vsphere-part-1/","summary":"Most of you already know how to clone virtual machines within vSphere, and I mean cloning from the vSphere Web client within vCenter but, beyond that, there are other types of clones you can use in vCenter like, Linked Clones or Instant Clones (aka Project Fargo/VMfork)\n\nDue to the large content that can be discussed about each clone’s type, I decided to make a short series of posts talking about cloning VMs!","title":"Cloning virtual machines in vSphere series – Part 1: Types of clone"},{"content":"Regarding this nice article, I read while ago from Eric Shanks: https://theithollow.com/2018/03/26/fill-skills-tank/.\nI decided to write about it as it’s always in my mind since he published it. In particular, I will talk about what we should learn in order to fill a gap for a position/job in any technology and my experience.\n\nWhich path to choose? I started learning Microsoft (MS) products and then I learned other technologies like Virtualization, Cloud, Storage, etc. In any case, you don’t have to worry about which would be your first technology because you can move later if you realize it doesn’t fit you. \nFor example, you can start learning Linux (I hope I had taken that path!) instead of Windows and then move to Windows or learning about Storage, any path would be correct as long as you continue to learn the same technology or a new one.\nWhen you start learning, you have an idea of what do you want to learn: Network, Cloud, Storage, etc. and then try to master that technology or move on to another one. Hence, you must start somewhere in order to grow your knowledge and then, you will decide which technology or technologies do you want to focus on.\nAs soon as you start you will notice if you like or not, but choose one!\n\nKnowledge lost as a tank with a leak. As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, Eric Shanks mentioned in his blog https://theithollow.com/2018/03/26/fill-skills-tank/ , is like filling a tank (which drains as time passes by) with your knowledge:\nWhen you learn a new topic it stays in your mind (won’t drain) as long as you keep using it, hence you will gain different levels of knowledge within the topic, in some years maybe you will achieve an advance and then maybe an expert level or maybe not, as not everyone has the ease to learn things. Also, remember that to maintain a certain level you must update your wisdom (due to the topic is always acquiring new updates or features) about the topic and therefore more effort and time to put on.\nYou can try to learn other things and try to earn the same level of knowledge in each one but, it can be tough to do…You must spend a lot of time updating the different topics and to maintain it. So, we should try to fill our tank with the knowledge we really want or desire (by testing, reading, writing, etc.), in this way, we could maintain a great level of wisdom but, nothing is more useful than practising!\n\nIn my personal experience, when you are learning something new (by reading or watching videos) at the end, there is nothing more useful than practising it in a lab, even if you know the steps. \nIt’s really a way to ingrain in your mind those steps and if you fail when deploying a new product or feature it’s even better 🙂\nFilling the gap, but which? This is what I really wanted to talk.\nSometimes, it can be really hard to achieve a new position because you notice that there are some gaps between your skills and the desired position/job.\nAbout dream jobs… For example, if your dream position is to be a Technical Architect, you must be good enough in a lot of topics (networking, storage, virtualization, soft skills, etc.) but, can be very difficult to earn expertise on each area(without mentioning the soft skills needed).\n\nAs you know, each matter has sub-matters, for example, if you want to learn VMware, you can learn the Server virtualization platform (vSphere) but, there are other areas like Storage virtualization platform (vSAN) and Network virtualization and Security platform (NSX) for example.\nSo, here we see that you can be an expert on vSphere but, a lot of positions will demand that you know about vSAN or NSX for example, and you spent a lot of time and effort on being a great expert on vSphere.Then, do you really need to gain an advanced level before applying to a position that requires it?\nWell, it depends, you should figure it out with the Recruiter but at least earn an entry level in the skills that the job requests.\nWe can conclude that to achieve that position, you must do an approach to each technology so, it usually takes a lot of years of experience and learning\nAbout filling the gap Another example, if you are a Windows Administrator and now you want to learn about Azure, well, it’s related to Microsoft but it’s different than learning about an another OS. In this case, you should gain knowledge in areas like Storage, Networking and maybe some coding skills.\nHence, we can conclude that you should try to learn at least a bit of every technology (related to your main knowledge) and trying to maintain/update your knowledge in those areas.\nAlso, bear in mind that the more you learn about different topics, the more you «lose» in other ones, so, my personal advice is to stay close of what do you want to learn and don’t be shy to learn about what you don’t.\n    ","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2019-01-31-it-skills-which-gap-to-fill/","summary":"Regarding this nice article, I read while ago from Eric Shanks: https://theithollow.com/2018/03/26/fill-skills-tank/.\nI decided to write about it as it’s always in my mind since he published it.

A lot of partners in this Hall where you can chat with people that work in the company and have great discussions, gather some swag and maybe you can win something in the raffle (yes, a lot of companies offered free tickets and there were big prizes like a Nintendo Switch, Apple Watch, etc.) !\nVeeam’s party I was so lucky to be invited to this party and what a nice party! I only can say that there were good drinks, food and of course music! It was in a famous discotheque called Apollo.\n Bad quality picture from the Veeam party I know it’s not the best quality but, is just to show you how it looked:\nAnd that’s all… I had to leave «early», around 12 AM as I had to commute by train so, I didn’t have a chance to stay and enjoy this party.\n\nP.S.: I forgot to mention that each day there is a free lunch in a specific area where you can grab food. The lunchtime I think that I was delivered between 12:00 – 2:00 PM\nThe next post, the third day!\n","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2018-12-13-vmworld-18-eu-day2/","summary":"Today I am going to explain from my personal experience, the Day 2 at VMworld 2018 Europe, lots of networking, some technical sessions, events and the Solutions Exchange.\n\nBefore moving forward, I forgot to mention that I met in my first day a nice guy, Daniel Paluszek @dpaluszek, we had a great conversation and he should be known as the vCloud Director guy ;).\nvBreakfast If you don’t what is, check it here: http://www.","title":"Experience at VMworld 2018 Europe – Day 2"},{"content":"VMworld 2018 Europe is only a week away!

I am going to talk about my VCAP6-DCV Deploy exam experience.\nI thought about making a huge post about the VCAP6-DCV experience (resources, notes, etc.) but, I don’t want to overwhelm you know. Hence, I am going to make another post for that, hence this post will be shorter and more readable.\n1st attempt (Java error at the beginning) At September, 21st I sat down to take my first attempt in a VCAP exam. I was confident because I was studying the previous 10 weeks approximately and I covered all the objectives.\nWell, my exam was scheduled at 10:00 AM, I sat down and my exam starts. The interface is exactly the same as the HOLs, so, if you familiarized with it, you will gain a lot of time!\nThe lab was deploying and the manual on the right side showed some information but as soon as the lab finishes to deploy…bum!\nA Java error appeared: Java error: Unhandled Exception, then I pressed OK and my exam finishes itself!\nI contacted the TA and she told me that my exam was finished, and I was like «What? In 2 minutes?». After spending some hours with Pearson VUE, the TA (Test Administrator) opened a case with Pearson VUE and I left the Test Center.\nI left with a feeling that this test center has serious issues, the TA didn’t know how to speak in English (I was taking it in Barcelona, Spain) and finally, I ended talking my self with Pearson VUE and explaining the problem. They couldn’t do anything as my exam was finished (it wasn’t my fault obviously)\nA week later I received a voucher code for my crashed exam.\n2nd attempt (Manual stuck in loading) This second attempt was scheduled at October, 5th. I rescheduled in another Test Center as I didn’t trust the TA for that Test Center.\nThe problem you face with the VCAP exams is that they are delivered in fewer Test Centers, therefore, there are less available spots to take it. I found another Test Center here in Barcelona, so I scheduled there even I didn’t know that one.\nWell, my exam started at 10:00 am, the server’s console loaded correctly after the lab was deployed (nice!) but, the manual didn’t appear, there was only a grey window without content.\nAfter waiting for 5 minutes, I spoke with the TA, and he told me to wait another 5 minutes. So, as expected, the manual was stuck loading and even trying to stop and start the exam didn’t fix the problem.\nHence, the TA contacts Pearson VUE and Pearson VUE fixed the problem this time! But what happened with all the time I lost in my exam? Well, the TA told me Pearson VUE would contact with VMware and the time will be added meanwhile I am taking it.\nAt that time, the exam started again but I had a weird feeling about.\nIn the exam, I finished writing down each question number and a brief description on the erasable board, in this manner, I could check quickly which questions I can take first and cross out which I have done.\nIt was curious that at times, backspace and shift keys worked in Putty. Also, occasionally, during 5-10 minutes I experienced quite delay with the Web Client. I continued with the exam, contacted with the TA about the time but no response from Pearson VUE and time were running out…\nThe time isn’t going to be added, hence, I had to left like 4 or 5 empty questions because I didn’t have more time (I lost 30 minutes) and the exam finalizes automatically. I felt bad because of the 30 mins. would be nice to try other questions.\n\nAfter that, I spoke with the TA and he opened a case with Pearson VUE about the time lost. One hour later, I received my score report, 278/500 (almost got it!).\nAfter a few days, Pearson VUE reviewed my case and, as I was close to passing the exam (remember that you need 300/500), I suppose they decided to give me another voucher code, so I felt good about the free re-schedule but bad for the score and the time lost.\n3rd attempt (Redeployed lab and final attempt) Well, this is really a lie, because I «took» 2 exams in a row. Let me explain…\nOn October, 16th, my exam was scheduled at 10:00 AM, I studied a bit the previous night just to remember some things. My last attempt was 11 days ago and I was focused on other things so, it’s always good to brush up some concepts.\nWell, the exam started and the lab was deploying itself… then, it appeared a notification like «Query not found». This time the manual loaded correctly, but the pop-up appeared all the time, appearing and disappearing, and the console didn’t load as the error appears instead.\nTherefore, the TA (Test Administrator) contacted Pearson VUE and for my surprise, Pearson VUE this time could contact VMware quite fast. The TA told me that VMware was going to redeploy another lab (Now my time wasn’t wasted at all!) and I could try in 30 minutes.\nFinally, I tried again and it worked correctly, the manual and console loaded correctly so, I took the exam. The connection seemed a bit better so I can’t complain about. Also, the backspace and shift keys worked as in my previous exam, therefore, I took advantage of it.\nNow, I tried to answer all questions (I left 1 answer empty because I didn’t want to lose more time) and I finished my exam (well the lab finished and it closes automatically) with a good feeling.\nIn 1 hour approximately I received the email and…a PASS! Couldn’t be happier! Finally, a full exam without issues made me pass the exam!\nConclusion I can do a recap of what I learned about my experience with that exam and all the issues I experienced:\n If you have any problem, contact your TA, don\u0026#8217;t waste time to wait for the manual or console to load.   Test if backspace and shift keys work! I was concerned that these keys were blocked but I was able to use it and avoid the On-Screen keyboard, maybe it can work for you.   Manage your time, manage your time. Everything you will read about this exam (or new ones) is about managing your time and I couldn\u0026#8217;t agree more.    Use the erasable board! I used to write down each question number and a brief description, it helped me to know if I was running out of time and focus in the «easy» questions.   Be aware of the dates, it was like a month ago since I scheduled the first attempt, so, if you are going to take it because your certification is expiring, be sure to schedule it in advance.   I am not going sugar coat the fact that I was happy with the exam’s delivery because I suffered many issues…but, finally, with some patience it was paid-off.\nI hope this can be helpful for someone and I will write another post about the resources and how I prepared my self about this exam.\n Thanks for reading!\nDan Belmonte\n","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2018-10-19-vcap6-dcv-deploy-exam-experience/","summary":"Hi!

I am going to repoint a vCenter with an embedded PSC (a vCSA called «pokecenter») to an external PSC I created in a Windows server called «digicenter» (I know is kinda original). Digicenter is already joined to the same SSO domain as pokecenter.\n  Note: If you have any problem when adding an external PSC to an existing SSO domain, check cmsso-util unregister command in the vCSA appliance. In my case, I had to re-install it three times and in the last one, I used the command. \nMore information in KB: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2114233\n In the vCenter with embedded PSC, I will connect through SSH and repoint my vCenter to the external Windows PSC «digicenter».\nThe command is: cmsso-util reconfigure –-repoint-psc digicenter.pokemon.jp –username administrator –domain-name vsphere.local –passwd VMware1!\n\nNow, time to wait, it will take a couple of minutes as the text says: And after the pass, successful!\n Hence, our vCenter «pokecenter» has an external PSC «digicenter».

Besides there are other useful options within NIOC capabilities, today, I will focus only in the network adapter bandwidth limit for VMs.\nPrerequisites: Enable the feature in the dvSwitch (in our case the one with Data Network):Scenario:\n2 VMs within 2 Networks (Portgroups in dvSwitch)\n\nKenshiroVM is a VM with Ubuntu that simulates traffic with iperf as a client.\nWin10Pro is a VM with iperf application configured as a server:\nObjective: We will look in how Network I/O control (NIOC) let us limit the bandwidth granularly from a Virtual Machine (KenshiroVM), so, we will limit the bandwidth for a single NIC and see if it really works.\nTesting: Lab time! I enabled NIOC in the dvSwitch that I have created for OS traffic (Data Network), dvSwitch is called “DSwitch_DataNW”. The other dvSwitch is “DSwitchMGMT” and NIOC is not enabled (no NIOC = no restrictions).\nAs I said before we have 2 networks:\n Data Network: 10.10.6.0/24 Management Network: 192.168.1.0/24  Main steps: 1. Verify that the client (KenshiroVM) has no restrictions within the network. 2. Then, we will limit the Data Network adapter from KenshiroVM, launch iperf to simulate traffic and review the limitation configured. 3. Finally we will test iperf again but in the Management Network and review that we have no restrictions.  1. Currently, KenshiroVM has no restrictions configured (notice that in the blue rectangle there are no options for NIOC because that portgroup (Management) it’s located in another dvSwitch where we didn’t enable NIOC):\n\nIf we launch iperf command with 200Mbps on port 9999 from KenshiroVM:\nWe can see the traffic \u0026gt;on the destination (Win10Pro) on the Data Network Adapter (you can see the subnet in the screenshot):\nAlso, we can review it in vSphere Web Client (25 MBps = 200 Mbps):\n2. Now we are going to set a limit on KenshiroVM Data Network adapter to 88 Mbits:\nNow, we perform the same command with iperf on the client (KenshiroVM):\nEven pushing 200 Mbits through the Data Netowork Adapter using iperf, NIOC will limit the traffic to 88 Mbits as set before. Here is the traffic seen by Win10Pro Data Network adapter:\n\nIn KenshiroVM, iperfperformed the transfer in 88 Mbps approximately:\n3. Now, if we do the same experiment (150 Mbps) but in the adapter where NIOC is not enabled:\n\nKenshiroVM confirmed that it performed at 150 Mbps approximately:\n  Conclusion    As a result of using vSphere NIOC, we can granularly set limits in the bandwidth in a VM network adapter and it will obey the settings configured. It only works for outbound traffic, if you set a limit in a destination VM adapter, then, NIOC will not make any restrictions regarding the inbound traffic.\n","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2018-08-03-vsphere-network-i-o-control-nic-limit-bandwidth/","summary":"Today let’s talk about vSphere Network I/O Control (NIOC) version 3 (vSphere 6.0), it’s a feature in the vSphere Distributed Switch that allows you to control granularly the output/egress bandwidth from a VM network adapter level.

So you can use different stacks to support in different ways a service within the stack.\nA quick look at the services you can choose when creating a VMkernel port:\nI am not going to explain each one because we are going to focus on vMotion and Provisioning traffic.\n\nContinuing with TCP/IP stacks, when you create a new VMkernel in an ESXi host, you can choose which services do you want to enable: \nRegarding vMotion and Provisioning TCP/IP stacks you could do it in two ways:\n For vMotion, for example, you can do the following (this is the most common configuration, Default TCP/IP stack with a service Enabled):   Or (Dedicated TCP/IP stack):   I must admit I always use the first one, the Default TCP/IP stack with the service enabled, so which should we use, the dedicated stack or the default one?\nDedicated TCP/IP stack options  vMotion: It provides better isolation (more security), a separate set of buffers and sockets and avoids routing table conflicts than using the same TCP/IP Stack. Provisioning:  Used for cold VM migration (migrate power-off VMs), cloning and snapshot traffic.  So, I discussed with some people because I wanted to know which benefit could give you to use the dedicated TCP/IP stacks and this is what I gathered:\n\n For vMotion: As a short answer, I would say, that if you need to do Cross vCenter vMotion you will need it because the dedicated stack gives you a Layer 3 VMkernel, meaning routing. With a dedicated stack, you can change the Gateway and DNS used in the default TCP/IP stack, meaning that you don’t have to use the same stack options that other services.do. For Provisioning traffic: If you have massive data coming from snapshots or cloning, is better that you use this dedicated stack instead of the default one.  In the end, this is my recap and I hope it can help someone that is not familiar with it. Obviously, you could use the dedicated TCP/IP stack whenever you want but bear in mind that it will disable that service in the rest of the VMkernels.\n\nAnyway, if you think that I missed or want to discuss something, let me know in the comments!\n","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2018-07-23-vmkernel-vmotion-and-provisioning-dedicated-tcp-ip-stacks/","summary":"It’s been a while since I posted something, but I was busy with university duties and to be honest I couldn’t spend time on publishing things but, here we are!\nFirst, I am currently studying for the VCAP6 – DCV Deployment Exam (3V0-623) and I am learning a lot with it, so maybe I will post more topics related with.\nToday I am going to talk about TCP/IP stacks in VMkernels (for vSphere 6).","title":"VMkernel: vMotion and Provisioning in dedicated TCP/IP stacks"},{"content":"Hello everyone!\nIt’s been a while since I wrote something, but I was so busy with other things (University) and I wasn’t able to allocate time to write anything.\nToday I’m going to talk about an issue I found on Azure when trying to add new rules to some NSGs.\nTo create rules in Azure I used this script from TechNet Gallery: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Create-Azure-Network-5f5c5332\nProblem I was trying to add some rules in an NSG with the address 193.23.120.230/30 and, when I execute the code, the output was:\nSet-AzureRmNetworkSecurityGroup : Security rule has invalid Address prefix.

The only thing is to commute by train between home and Fira Barcelona (where VMworld is established). \nIt was Monday, November 5th, 2018. I woke up around 6 AM and took the train to arrive at 8 AM approximately.\nThis is how the entrance looked:Inside VMworld I picked up my badge (using a QR code from the VMworld app) and headed to the VMvillage (the main place on this event). After taking some pictures… I went to take a lab at the HOL Lounge, why? Because I wanted to try new labs, there are more slots available and I wanted to feel an experience like that at VMworld. Also, you learn some coins for the VMware code ( http://vmwcc.com/).\nThe first day is the calm day, I mean, the Solutions Exchange (where partners have their booths) is not opened and there are less interesting sessions (at least for my self) than other days. People usually are on TAM/Partners sessions or maybe they come on Tuesday.\nI explored every enclosure’s corner and checked where were all Halls (to not waste more time the next day). There was food everywhere, from sandwiches to pastries and of course coffee, you could pick it on any lounge or at the VMvillage for free.\n\nIn the middle of the VMvillage, there was a Gaming Area with a table tennis table, pinball machines, a giant table football and more things… my favourite part, the Arcade machines with a lot of games!\n\nI was eager to meet some people I met on Twitter and of course, I did it!\nThe first person I met was Graham Barker @VirtualG_UK an awesome guy who which I spent some time in the beginning, now I am thinking we didn’t take a selfie…\nAlso, I met Angelo Luciani @AngeloLuciani, very kind guy! He takes selfies with a lot of people and always open to anyone, I chatted with him a bit and it was a pleasure.\n\nSee you…tomorrow! At the end of the day, I had some workshops to attend and couldn’t meet more people (obviously some of them are busy in the first day) but this only was the beginning of an awesome journey that will start at the next day, when the action begins.\n\nI returned home early as I had things to do and also on the next day vBreakfast will be awaiting me (at 7:00 AM). \nSo, the first day was a great experience, is more dedicated for the partners but maybe you can network with people that on the next days will have no time (as probably you).\n\nIn the next post, the second day, hasta la vista!\n","permalink":"https://dangaiden.github.io/2018-11-19-vmworld-18-eu-day1/","summary":"Let me talk to you about my experience on my first VMworld!
