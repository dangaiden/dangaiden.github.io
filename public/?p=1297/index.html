By the way, vCommunity means virtual community and not VMware Community ðŸ˜‰This year, I was able to help as a Champion for the Tech Level up Projectwhich is the one who made The vTrail Map(A community guide for your virtualization journey)!You can get the digital version herefor free!Many people from the vCommunity as Champions delivered lots of physical copies of the vTrail Map at VMworld just to engage them in our community.Â 1st general session Although there werenâ€™t bigger announcements like at the VMworld US, there were some new projects and features that were announced.Day 1 (Now talking about November 5th) is more focused on announcements about new products, strategies and gives you a better vision of what VMware has to offer with new features, insights, etc.Here you have the link for the first session: Day 1 General Session (November 5th)  vBrownbag Tech Talks On Day 1 there wasnâ€™t much to do as we couldnâ€™t record anything at the vBrownbag stage.Gregg Robertson (vBrownbag member) likes to make fun of me a bit while I am performing tests on the stage:Â On Day 2 we started the vBrownbag Tech Talks at the VMware Community booth from 11:00 AM to 5:00 PM.Ariel SÃ¡nchez, Alastair Cooke and me recorded around 15 sessions where many people from the vCommunity among other companies that showed us their community programs, new features, versions, etc.Although I was Â«anchoredÂ» at the VMware community booth recording people with the mixed audio and all of the vBrownbag members helping the presenters (and recording as well), it was so nice to spend time there with lots of new and old people from the community.Also, I learned from each session that we recorded. If the topic is a bit interesting for me, it was great to hear about it and even ask the presenter.Here you have a picture of me while I was recording my friend Jorge de la Cruz!Enjoying VMworld And here I share with you some events, moments and things that couldnâ€™t be possible without the vCommunity.All these moments are perfect to meet new people, engage with them and have fun!vFit Run In the early morning (6:45 AM) we did a run on the first day (November 4th) with some people from the community. It was so nice but at the same time painful to wake up at that timeâ€¦There was a second run scheduled for November 6th but I couldnâ€™t attend so I assume that it wasnâ€™t done.vSoccer So, a run for me in the morning and at nightâ€¦soccer, no, vSoccer!Jorge Torres organized a match between friends within the community and it was fantastic. We rent a field and after the match, we had a light dinner with some finger-food, omelets, etc. I absolutely recommend you to join the next one!vStreetfighter Wellâ€¦ this can happen at any hourâ€¦ Gregg, Ariel and I love Street Fighter so, if you want to play with us at VMworld (or online) just let us know.We have our own hashtag: #vStreetfightervBreakfast Another amazing event from the vCommunity (organized by Fred Hofer). This is always done on the second day (November 5th) before the general session. There is a special place where we have a great breakfast and if there is a sponsor (Runecast) you will have it for free ðŸ™‚But the main point here is, meet new people, talk with them and have a nice breakfast before going to the conference center!Â And that would be all I wanted to share from the first 2 days, I will post the remaining ones in the same format.I hope you enjoy it!Â Â Â Â ",
