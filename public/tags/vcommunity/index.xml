      <description>Here I will explain a summary of days 1 and 2 (November 4th and 5th) of VMworld Europe 2019 from my perspective.So, the first official day is on Monday (November 4th) where there arenâ€™t many people like the next day (the second day, Tuesday 5th) but anyway there are many activities to do!This time I was awarded a blogger pass, hence, I will have the honor to be with other bloggers at VMworld while enjoying some privileges like having a reserved seat in the general session, stay with other bloggers or join some special events.</description>

      <description>Yes! I am happy to announce that the vFit eventwill happen also at VMworld Europe this year!Eric Wright (@discoposse) is the creator of this event and you can check how it went at VMworld US here! I love his idea of engaging folks who attend tech events to do some exercise at tech events and why not at VMworld Europe? Enjoy a run with our great community outside VMworld. You can meet people, share a great moment to run outside the event centersand enjoy the city of Barcelona.</description>
