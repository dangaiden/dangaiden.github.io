      <description>Continuing with the cloning virtual machines in vSphereseries, today I am going to write about the full clone, how it works and some useful information about it.So, let’s talk about clones… but just full clones.How does it work? As you probably know a full clone is an exact copy of a source VM, meaning that, everything from the parent VM is copied (VM settings, disks, files, etc.).This action can be performed if the parent VM is powered off or powered onand, if it has snapshots it will consolidate them once the clone is done.</description>
