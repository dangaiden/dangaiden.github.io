      <description>Here I will explain a summary of days 1 and 2 (November 4th and 5th) of VMworld Europe 2019 from my perspective.So, the first official day is on Monday (November 4th) where there aren’t many people like the next day (the second day, Tuesday 5th) but anyway there are many activities to do!This time I was awarded a blogger pass, hence, I will have the honor to be with other bloggers at VMworld while enjoying some privileges like having a reserved seat in the general session, stay with other bloggers or join some special events.</description>

      <description>Yes! I am happy to announce that the vFit eventwill happen also at VMworld Europe this year!Eric Wright (@discoposse) is the creator of this event and you can check how it went at VMworld US here! I love his idea of engaging folks who attend tech events to do some exercise at tech events and why not at VMworld Europe? Enjoy a run with our great community outside VMworld. You can meet people, share a great moment to run outside the event centersand enjoy the city of Barcelona.</description>

      <description>To finish these posts about VMworld 2018 Europe, I am going to summarize day 3 and day 4 together as day 4 is usually the less busy of all of them (people usually leave in the morning).On day 3 (Wednesday), I rest like 5-6 hours (pretty normal to me) after spending some part of the night at the Veeam Party. I made it to be at the enclosure at 8:30 AM because at 9:00 it will start the second general session.</description>

      <description>Let me talkto you about my experience on my first VMworld! This is a personal experience I want to share about Day 1 at VMworld 2018 Europe.Introduction I live in Barcelona so, I am fortunate that I don’t need to travel to go to the VMworld Europe. The only thing is to commute by train between home and Fira Barcelona (where VMworld is established). It was Monday, November 5th, 2018. I woke up around 6 AM and took the train to arrive at 8 AM approximately.</description>
