      <description>Let me talkto you about my experience on my first VMworld! This is a personal experience I want to share about Day 1 at VMworld 2018 Europe.Introduction I live in Barcelona so, I am fortunate that I don’t need to travel to go to the VMworld Europe. The only thing is to commute by train between home and Fira Barcelona (where VMworld is established). It was Monday, November 5th, 2018. I woke up around 6 AM and took the train to arrive at 8 AM approximately.</description>
