      <description>Let’s start with part 3 in the cloning virtual machines in vSphereseries, I am going to talk about another type of clones, linked clones! All articles regarding cloning virtual machines in vSphereseries:As said in previous articles, this series is only focused on VMware vSphere hence, VMware Horizon View is not contemplated (Linked clones are commonly usedin that product). What is a linked clone? What can you see here?
In the previous image, you can see 3 different characters but they share something in common…the actor!</description>

      <description>Continuing with the cloning virtual machines in vSphereseries, today I am going to write about the full clone, how it works and some useful information about it.So, let’s talk about clones… but just full clones.How does it work? As you probably know a full clone is an exact copy of a source VM, meaning that, everything from the parent VM is copied (VM settings, disks, files, etc.).This action can be performed if the parent VM is powered off or powered onand, if it has snapshots it will consolidate them once the clone is done.</description>
