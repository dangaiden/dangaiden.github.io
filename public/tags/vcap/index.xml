      <description>As the VCAP-DCV Design 2020 certification is going to be released(but the 3V0-624 exam is not scheduled to be retired yet) on Jan 1, 2020.Recently I made another post about my experience with this exam where I failed, check it here.For your information, at the moment the 3V0-624 is the current exam code for the VCAP-DCV 6.5 Designcertification (Also named VCAP-DCV Design 2019), always check the code for the exam no matter which is the certification name.</description>

      <description>Recently I took the 3V0-624exam (a.k.a. VMware Certified Advanced Professional 6.5 – Data Center Virtualization Design Exam) and I failed (266/500).I took it on September, 4th (a month and a half ago) and as I was on holiday and now preparing things for VMworld Europe I won’t be able to study after the event.I recognize, I study a bit in a rush. In just one month for someone who is daily tasks aren’t about architecture, it can be hard (or not).</description>

      <description>Hi! I am going to talk about my VCAP6-DCV Deploy exam experience.I thought about making a huge post about the VCAP6-DCV experience (resources, notes, etc.) but, I don’t want to overwhelm you know. Hence, I am going to make another post for that, hence this post will be shorter and more readable.1st attempt (Java error at the beginning) At September, 21st I sat down to take my first attempt in a VCAP exam.</description>
