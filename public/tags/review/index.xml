      <description>I havenâ€™t thought of doing this kind of review but reading some of them through the internet, it motivated me to do it.Also by submitting to programs like vExpertfrom VMware, made me realize that I did many things this year that I forgot and were amazing.2019 Timeline  January: Going to the gym to get healthier knees and finished exams from the university with good scores. Semester ends. February: New semester (about my degree) and many things planned.</description>
