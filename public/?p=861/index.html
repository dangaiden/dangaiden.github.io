It provides a unified view and access to converge that secondary data, such as system backups and analytics in a simpler way to an IT administrator. Now, let’s deep intothe topic.In the video, you will see how Alastair Cooke and Bharath Nagaraj building a Cohesity cluster from the scratch, configuring jobs, updating the physical appliance, restoring some data and showing some other cool stuff.I really like this kind of videos because, you can see how they install a cluster, configure it or resolve any problems that can happen in real time without cuts.Also, you can notice how much time it can take to deploy and configure a Cohesity cluster in some minutes, or even upgrading the whole cluster (node by node) while running some protection jobs (backup jobs).Hardware In this case, they use a physicalunit for deploying their solution, so it’s a 2U enclosure with 4 servers/nodes inside (blade server type). It comes,like most other solutions, with 1GB ports for Management purposes and 10GB ports for Production Data.As this is an HCI solution, it comes with the storage and computesresources necessary to process and store all data (PCIe Flash card and hard drives in each node). Cluster configuration and UI To configure the cluster you won’t need a lot of data to fill or knowledge to do it, they configure the cluster easier than I thought and straightforward. In a real scenario, a Cohesity engineer will do it for you thus, this is just to let you know of the simplicity of it.The UI is simple and clean, the home dashboard looks nice with some graphics regarding your Storage Reduction, Health, Throughput, Protection Runs, etc.Backup As you probably guess, it backups your vSphere/Hyper-V/Nutanix environment like other products do, so you can configure a Backup Policy with a schedule, time retention, etc. to back upyour data and then you configure a Protection job which will be the backup job that is associated to a policy.Just register the hypervisor of your choice and basically, you’re ready to back up your virtual servers (VMs). One option I really liked when registering a hypervisor was, the option of selecting «Auto Cancel Backup if Datastore is running low on space», so the DataPlatform solution is aware of the datastore’s space and can avoid you a big problem there… About granularity, there is a lot of options to select when you create a protection job (DB, Virtual/Physical Servers, but regarding what you can see in the video they protected only VMs and Office 365 mailboxes in different backup policies.It’s great that when you are creating a protection job (a.k.a. backup job). you can select an object like a cluster or a folder with some particular VMs and then check the «Autoprotect» option to ensure that new VMs that are added to that object (folder, cluster, etc.) will be automatically protected. Regarding long term retentions, you can choose to add an external target like a NAS or any cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) to store your archive backups there.This is an option that adds great value to your strategy because when storing great amounts of data for several years, you usually don’t want to store it locally or even in a NAS.In my opinion, having a flexible option to store it in any cloud can save you a lot of headaches despite the money that you must pay for the cloud service (which nowadays almost every company does).So, within a Backup policy select the Archival option and then you add as many external targets to store your long term backups. Restore Your backup strategy is useless unless you can restore from it…Ido like some points about this section that makes so simple to restore, from a single file (even download it) to restore tons of virtual machines to your virtual environment.– Single file restore If you want to recover a file, you don’t have to search for the date, where it was, etc. As simple as searching for the name of the file (or the portion you remember) and it will be searched in the entire cluster for you:And then, when you found that file, look at the options that we have:First, search for the date and then,you can choose the usual option (Recover to Server) or … download it at the moment (a cool option there).It looks like a painless and simpleway to restore files that probably a non-tech person could do.– Instant mass restore Now, going bigger, let’s talk about the Cohesity instant mass restoreof virtual machines. As the Cohesity platform is designed in a distributed architecturewhere there isn’t a centralized bottleneck, they can restore tons of VMs quite faster than other products.When recovering a lot of VMs, in the background (you could look at your vSphere environment) it will mount an NFSdatastore and bring up all you requested VMs (quite fast to be honest).– Office 365 Finally, the last thing to show you is theoption to backup your Office 365environment. You can integrate Cohesity with your Office 365 and perform protection jobs that will be associated with a policy and consolidate all the data within the same platform.Upgrading The process is straightforward, selecting a package from your local computer or getting it from the Internet, this makes it so easy to do it for yourself.One thing that stuckin my mind was that, while there were running some protection jobs you are able to upgrade the whole cluster (node by node) non-disruptively.As the entire solution is designed to tolerate one node failure (N+1 redundancy) thus, you can upgrade one node without disruption in the service.As we said before, the Cohesity platform is based in a distributed architectureso, in case a reboot is required after upgrading one of the nodes, you will only lose the bandwidthcoming from that node and not impacting the rest of the environment.Helios Cohesity Heliosis the console that lets you manage and view all your clusters from one console. As it’s in the cloud, you only have to register your Cohesity appliance and at the end, it will show up in the Helios console.Helios Dashboard is similar to a Cohesity management dashboard but with the ability to manage all your clusters from that single pane of glass.And it’s just not that… Helios lets you install applications!Yes, you can choose to install applications in one of your clusters without anything else. What Helios will do is to deploy an app within a container (using Kubernetes) in that cluster without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.Just install, configure and run your app (as it sounds).For example, running Splunk to gather data analytics in your clusters without having to worry about to deploy it is really a nice feature to look at it. I’ve never seen a feature like that and it really surprised me when I saw it. A nice additional value that you can consider when using Helios with your Cohesity platform.Other use cases As the Cohesity platform is cloud and hypervisor agnostic, you can protect objects on any cloud Azure/GCP/AWS or any hypervisor Hyper-V/VMware/Nutanix but, do you imagine what else can you do?Well, you can use it to migrate VMs between different environments! It’s a great use case where you can choose to backup all your vSphere environment and move it to Nutanix for example or moving it to Azure. Obviously, there is work to do after it but, the amount of simplicity that gives you with that, for me, it’s massive.That’s all… We saw a lot of things from the Cohesity platform, how can help your company to achieve that data consolidation by:backing upfrom different clouds and environments (cloud and hypervisor agnostic) , establishing an SLAin your services (configuring policies),recovering tons of VMsand other features like Helios, a cloud console that brings you a unified view for your Cohesity environment, analytics for all your data and even the ability to deploy applications without needing any kind of resources.If you are interested in more content, check the Cohesity Build Day Live web pageor the official web page from Cohesity. ",

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, going bigger, let’s talk about the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cohesity instant mass restore<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> of virtual machines. As the Cohesity platform is designed in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->distributed architecture<!-- raw HTML omitted --> where there isn’t a centralized bottleneck, they can restore tons of VMs quite faster than other products.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When recovering a lot of VMs, in the background (you could look at your vSphere environment) it will mount <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->an NFS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->datastore and bring up all you requested VMs (quite fast to be honest).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h4 id="span-stylefont-family-didact-gothic8211-office-365span"><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->– Office 365<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#span-stylefont-family-didact-gothic8211-office-365span">#</a></h4>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, the last thing to show you is the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backup your Office 365<!-- raw HTML omitted --> environment. You can integrate Cohesity with your Office 365 and perform protection jobs that will be associated with a policy and consolidate all the data within the same platform.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<h2 id="span-stylefont-family-didact-gothicupgradingspan"><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Upgrading<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#span-stylefont-family-didact-gothicupgradingspan">#</a></h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The process is straightforward, selecting a package from your local computer or getting it from the Internet, this makes it so easy to do it for yourself.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One thing that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stuck<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in my mind was that, while there were running some protection jobs you are able to upgrade the whole cluster (node by node) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->non-disruptively.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As the entire solution is designed to tolerate one node failure (N+1 redundancy) thus, you can upgrade one node without disruption in the service.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As we said before, the Cohesity platform i<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s based in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->distributed architecture<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so, in case a reboot is required after upgrading one of the nodes, you will only lose the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bandwidth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> coming from that node and not impacting the rest of the environment.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-family-didact-gothicheliosspan"><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Helios<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#span-stylefont-family-didact-gothicheliosspan">#</a></h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cohesity Helios<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the console that lets you manage and view all your clusters from one console. As it’s in the cloud, you only have to register your Cohesity appliance and at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->end<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it will show up in the Helios console.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Helios Dashboard is similar to a Cohesity management dashboard but with the ability to manage all your clusters from that single pane of glass.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And it’s just not that… Helios lets you install applications!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, you can choose to install applications in one of your clusters without anything else. What Helios will do is to deploy an app within a container (using Kubernetes) in that cluster without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just install, configure and run your app (as it sounds).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For example, running Splunk to gather data analytics in your clusters without having to worry about to deploy it is really a nice feature to look at it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’ve never seen a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feature <!-- raw HTML omitted -->like that and it really surprised me when I saw it. A nice additional value that you can consider when using Helios with your Cohesity platform.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-family-didact-gothicother-use-casesspan"><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Other use cases<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#span-stylefont-family-didact-gothicother-use-casesspan">#</a></h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As the Cohesity platform is cloud and hypervisor agnostic, you can protect objects on any cloud Azure/GCP/AWS or any hypervisor Hyper-V/VMware/Nutanix but, do you imagine what else can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you do?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, you can use it to migrate VMs between different environments! It’s a great use case where you can choose to backup all your vSphere environment and move it to Nutanix for example or moving it to Azure. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Obviously, there is work to do after it but, the amount of simplicity that gives you with that, for me, it’s massive.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-family-didact-gothicthat8217s-all8230span"><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That’s all…<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#span-stylefont-family-didact-gothicthat8217s-all8230span">#</a></h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We saw a lot of things from the Cohesity platform, how can help your company to achieve that data consolidation by:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> backing up<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from different clouds and environments (cloud and hypervisor agnostic) , <!-- raw HTML omitted -->establishing an SLA<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in your services (configuring policies),<!-- raw HTML omitted --> recovering tons of VMs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and other features like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Helios<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a cloud console that brings you a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unified view for your Cohesity environment<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, analytics for all your data and even the ability to deploy applications without needing any kind of resources.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
