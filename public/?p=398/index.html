The only thing is to commute by train between home and Fira Barcelona (where VMworld is established). It was Monday, November 5th, 2018. I woke up around 6 AM and took the train to arrive at 8 AM approximately.This is how the entrance looked:Inside VMworld I picked up my badge (using a QR code from the VMworld app) and headed to the VMvillage (the main place on this event). After taking some pictures… I went to take a lab at the HOL Lounge, why? Because I wanted to try new labs, there are more slots available and I wanted to feel an experience like that at VMworld. Also, you learn some coins for the VMware code ( http://vmwcc.com/).The first day is the calm day, I mean, the Solutions Exchange (where partners have their booths) is not opened and there are less interesting sessions (at least for my self) than other days. People usually are on TAM/Partners sessions or maybe they come on Tuesday.I explored every enclosure’s corner and checked where were all Halls (to not waste more time the next day). There was food everywhere, from sandwiches to pastries and of course coffee, you could pick it on any lounge or at the VMvillage for free.In the middle of the VMvillage, there was a Gaming Area with a table tennis table, pinball machines, a giant table football and more things… my favourite part, the Arcade machines with a lot of games!I was eager to meet some people I met on Twitter and of course, I did it!The first person I met was Graham Barker @VirtualG_UKan awesome guy who which I spent some time in the beginning, now I am thinking we didn’t take a selfie…Also, I met Angelo Luciani @AngeloLuciani, very kind guy! He takes selfies with a lot of people and always open to anyone, I chatted with him a bit and it was a pleasure.See you…tomorrow! At the end of the day, I had some workshops to attend and couldn’t meet more people (obviously some of them are busy in the first day) but this only was the beginning of an awesome journey that will start at the next day, when the action begins.I returned home early as I had things to do and also on the next day vBreakfast will be awaiting me (at 7:00 AM). So, the first day was a great experience, is more dedicated for the partners but maybe you can network with people that on the next days will have no time (as probably you).In the next post, the second day, hasta la vista!",
