It’s an award that VMware gives to individuals who have contributed (a lot) to the VMware community.Only the contributions over the past year are evaluated, therefore, it is a program that requires constant dedication every year by being an evangelist and advocacy of VMware products.vExpert is not a certification! It’s an award that is given to individuals and not companies so,companies must not claim that title.Why become one? vExperts who participate in the program have access to exclusive benefits. One of the challenges that you will see is, the journey to be and to maintain it. As I will explain later, being active in the community (through different ways) is the key to become one!At VMworld there are some exclusive gifts, access and parties that are only accessible to vExperts but, interacting with the community will be always your best gift in my opinion.Here is a list of some of the benefits: Join the private Slack channel (which is quite active!). Permission to use the vExpert certificate and logo on your website, social media, etc. Private forums on communities.vmware.com. Private webinars with VMware partners as well as NFRs. Evaluation licenses (1 year period) for many VMware products for your home lab! Blogger early access program for vSphere and some other products. Your profile will be listed in a public vExpert online directory. Access to vExpert parties and exclusive gifts at both VMworld events. Preferent seating at VMworld Keynotes.  How-to Being a VMware vExpert is not a sprint and it doesn’t consist of making the greatest amount of blog-posts about VMware.To become a VMware vExpert, you must be active in the community: This can be achieved by knowing and replying to people on Twitter, writing blog posts about VMware technologies, reply to the VMTN forums even if you don’t know the exact answer.Assisting or presenting to VMUG events is one of the best things you can do, not just to know people, promote yourself and learn new things also because you participate in the community and let yourself know.To apply just do it hereand list all the contributions from this year (2019).If you still have doubts, you can reachyour local vExpert PRO, which will help you with your submission. I can help you if you need some guidance or need any advice, just reach me on Twitter!Once you apply, your submission will be evaluated and once the applications are closed, the vExpert 2020 will be awarded.Summary By being part of the community and involving yourself more in evangelizing VMware products through posts, VMUG events/UserCons, VMTN forums, etc. you will have a high chance of being a vExpert.  Remember that in only will count the contributions from the previous year (2019 in this case) so, if you are not one know, don’t worry, apply if you think you contributed enough to the VMware community.You didn’t contribute enough or nothing this year? Set yourself a goal and make it happen for the next year!For me, being a vExpert gave me, not just licenses, gifts, etc. but many new friends of the community and a better knowledge of VMware products and culture.",
