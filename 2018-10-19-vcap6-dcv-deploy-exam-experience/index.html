Hence, I am going to make another post for that, hence this post will be shorter and more readable.\n1st attempt (Java error at the beginning) At September, 21st I sat down to take my first attempt in a VCAP exam. I was confident because I was studying the previous 10 weeks approximately and I covered all the objectives.\nWell, my exam was scheduled at 10:00 AM, I sat down and my exam starts. The interface is exactly the same as the HOLs, so, if you familiarized with it, you will gain a lot of time!\nThe lab was deploying and the manual on the right side showed some information but as soon as the lab finishes to deploy…bum!\nA Java error appeared: Java error: Unhandled Exception, then I pressed OK and my exam finishes itself!\nI contacted the TA and she told me that my exam was finished, and I was like «What? In 2 minutes?». After spending some hours with Pearson VUE, the TA (Test Administrator) opened a case with Pearson VUE and I left the Test Center.\nI left with a feeling that this test center has serious issues, the TA didn’t know how to speak in English (I was taking it in Barcelona, Spain) and finally, I ended talking my self with Pearson VUE and explaining the problem. They couldn’t do anything as my exam was finished (it wasn’t my fault obviously)\nA week later I received a voucher code for my crashed exam.\n2nd attempt (Manual stuck in loading) This second attempt was scheduled at October, 5th. I rescheduled in another Test Center as I didn’t trust the TA for that Test Center.\nThe problem you face with the VCAP exams is that they are delivered in fewer Test Centers, therefore, there are less available spots to take it. I found another Test Center here in Barcelona, so I scheduled there even I didn’t know that one.\nWell, my exam started at 10:00 am, the server’s console loaded correctly after the lab was deployed (nice!) but, the manual didn’t appear, there was only a grey window without content.\nAfter waiting for 5 minutes, I spoke with the TA, and he told me to wait another 5 minutes. So, as expected, the manual was stuck loading and even trying to stop and start the exam didn’t fix the problem.\nHence, the TA contacts Pearson VUE and Pearson VUE fixed the problem this time! But what happened with all the time I lost in my exam? Well, the TA told me Pearson VUE would contact with VMware and the time will be added meanwhile I am taking it.\nAt that time, the exam started again but I had a weird feeling about.\nIn the exam, I finished writing down each question number and a brief description on the erasable board, in this manner, I could check quickly which questions I can take first and cross out which I have done.\nIt was curious that at times, backspace and shift keys worked in Putty. Also, occasionally, during 5-10 minutes I experienced quite delay with the Web Client. I continued with the exam, contacted with the TA about the time but no response from Pearson VUE and time were running out…\nThe time isn’t going to be added, hence, I had to left like 4 or 5 empty questions because I didn’t have more time (I lost 30 minutes) and the exam finalizes automatically. I felt bad because of the 30 mins. would be nice to try other questions.\nAfter that, I spoke with the TA and he opened a case with Pearson VUE about the time lost. One hour later, I received my score report, 278/500 (almost got it!).\nAfter a few days, Pearson VUE reviewed my case and, as I was close to passing the exam (remember that you need 300/500), I suppose they decided to give me another voucher code, so I felt good about the free re-schedule but bad for the score and the time lost.\n3rd attempt (Redeployed lab and final attempt) Well, this is really a lie, because I «took» 2 exams in a row. Let me explain…\nOn October, 16th, my exam was scheduled at 10:00 AM, I studied a bit the previous night just to remember some things. My last attempt was 11 days ago and I was focused on other things so, it’s always good to brush up some concepts.\nWell, the exam started and the lab was deploying itself… then, it appeared a notification like «Query not found». This time the manual loaded correctly, but the pop-up appeared all the time, appearing and disappearing, and the console didn’t load as the error appears instead.\nTherefore, the TA (Test Administrator) contacted Pearson VUE and for my surprise, Pearson VUE this time could contact VMware quite fast. The TA told me that VMware was going to redeploy another lab (Now my time wasn’t wasted at all!) and I could try in 30 minutes.\nFinally, I tried again and it worked correctly, the manual and console loaded correctly so, I took the exam. The connection seemed a bit better so I can’t complain about. Also, the backspace and shift keys worked as in my previous exam, therefore, I took advantage of it.\nNow, I tried to answer all questions (I left 1 answer empty because I didn’t want to lose more time) and I finished my exam (well the lab finished and it closes automatically) with a good feeling.\nIn 1 hour approximately I received the email and…a PASS! Couldn’t be happier! Finally, a full exam without issues made me pass the exam!\nConclusion I can do a recap of what I learned about my experience with that exam and all the issues I experienced:\nIf you have any problem, contact your TA, don’t waste time to wait for the manual or console to load. Test if backspace and shift keys work! I was concerned that these keys were blocked but I was able to use it and avoid the On-Screen keyboard, maybe it can work for you. Manage your time, manage your time. Everything you will read about this exam (or new ones) is about managing your time and I couldn’t agree more. Use the erasable board! I used to write down each question number and a brief description, it helped me to know if I was running out of time and focus in the «easy» questions. Be aware of the dates, it was like a month ago since I scheduled the first attempt, so, if you are going to take it because your certification is expiring, be sure to schedule it in advance. I am not going sugar coat the fact that I was happy with the exam’s delivery because I suffered many issues…but, finally, with some patience it was paid-off.\nI hope this can be helpful for someone and I will write another post about the resources and how I prepared my self about this exam.\nThanks for reading!\nDan Belmonte\n",

I continued with the exam, contacted with the TA about the time but no response from Pearson VUE and time were running out…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">The time isn’t going to be added, hence, I had to left like 4 or 5 empty questions because I didn’t have more time (I lost 30 minutes) and the exam finalizes automatically. I felt bad because of the 30 mins. would be nice to try other questions.<br /> </span></p>
<p><span style="">After that, I spoke with the TA and he opened a case with Pearson VUE about the time lost. One hour later, I received my score report, 278/500 (almost got it!).</span></p>
<p><span style="">After a few days, Pearson VUE reviewed my case and, as I was close to passing the exam (remember that you need 300/500), I suppose they decided to give me another voucher code, so I felt good about the free re-schedule but bad for the score and the time lost.</span></p>

<p><span style="">Well, this is really a lie, because I «took» 2 exams in a row. Let me explain…</span></p>
<p><span style="">On October, 16th, my exam was scheduled at 10:00 AM, I studied a bit the previous night just to remember some things. My last attempt was 11 days ago and I was focused on other things so, it’s always good to brush up some concepts.</span></p>
<p><span style="">Well, the exam started and the lab was deploying itself… then, it appeared a notification like «Query not found». This time the manual loaded correctly, but the pop-up appeared all the time, appearing and disappearing, and the console didn’t load as the error appears instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="">Therefore, the TA (Test Administrator) contacted Pearson VUE and for my surprise, Pearson VUE this time could contact VMware quite fast. The TA told me that VMware was going to redeploy another lab (Now my time wasn’t wasted at all!) and I could try in 30 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="">Finally, I tried again and it worked correctly, the <strong>manual and console loaded correctly</strong> so, I took the exam. The connection seemed a bit better so I can’t complain about. Also, the backspace and shift keys worked as in my previous exam, therefore, I took advantage of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="">Now, I tried to answer all questions (I left 1 answer empty because I didn’t want to lose more time) and I finished my exam (well the lab finished and it closes automatically) with a good feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="">In 1 hour approximately I received the email and…a <strong>PASS</strong>! Couldn’t be happier! Finally, a full exam without issues made me <strong>pass the exam</strong>!</span></p>

<p><span style="">I can do a recap of what I learned about my experience with that exam and all the issues I experienced:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li>
    <span style="">If you have any problem, contact your TA, don&#8217;t waste time to wait for the manual or console to load.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">Test if backspace and shift keys work! I was concerned that these keys were blocked but I was able to use it and avoid the On-Screen keyboard, maybe it can work for you.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Manage your time</strong>, manage your time. Everything you will read about this exam (or new ones) is about managing your time and I couldn&#8217;t agree more. </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="">Use the <strong>erasable board</strong>! I used to write down each question number and a brief description, it helped me to know if I was running out of time and focus in the «easy» questions.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="">Be <strong>aware of the dates</strong>, it was like a month ago since I scheduled the first attempt, so, if you are going to take it because your certification is expiring, be sure to schedule it in advance.</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">I am not going sugar coat the fact that I was happy with the exam’s delivery because I suffered many issues…but, finally, with some patience it was paid-off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">I hope this can be helpful for someone and I will write another post about the resources and how I prepared my self about this exam.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">Thanks for reading!</span></p>
