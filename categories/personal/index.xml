      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start! Yes, it happened, in the past week&amp;hellip; I have moved to a new company!
After 2 months of challenges, interviews and so (that&amp;rsquo;s one of the main reasons that I haven&amp;rsquo;t published anything), I started in a new place that is completely different from where I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the past.
Instead of a consultancy, I am working in an end company, meaning, not working for different customers but for the same one, the company itself!</description>

      <description>Finally, after some time&amp;hellip; I am writing something here.
It&amp;rsquo;s being almost 5 months since I wrote my last blog post and it happened so fast but my final project kept me quite busy between November &amp;lsquo;20 and January &amp;lsquo;21.
After finishing my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree final project in January, I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying some free time for myself and with that, I «forgot» about writing (a.k.a. procrastination) but not anymore as I plan to start again writing as I did in the past.</description>
