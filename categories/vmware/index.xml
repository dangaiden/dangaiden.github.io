      <title>Is the applications’ future «containe(r)d»?</title>

      <description>Well, I’ll be lying if I haven’t heard of containers in the past years although I used them barely at my job (solutions engineer) shouldn’t I consider them more every time to replace the applications where my customers have their servers?
Like many people that work as sysadmin these days, they are used to work with virtualization, in particular Virtual Machines (VMs), customers still using them (and it will continue) to deploy their applications in an OS which delivers great benefits against the legacy approach of the Baremetal (Mainframe) era.</description>

      <title>Increasing the heap memory on vCSA 6.7 services</title>

      <description>For some reason, our monitoring alerted that the service “vsphere-ui” from the vCSA it was having some problems randomly. From the user perspective only we noticed some slowness when navigating within the HTML5 client.
I took a quick view of the VAMI I saw this message from the VMware vSphere Client service:
The server is running low on heap memory (&amp;gt;90% utilized.)
So it was time to solve those random alerts about memory utilization.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, we will see how to upgrade vRealize Operations (vROps) from version 6.7.0 to 8.0.1. The whole process takes about 30 minutes.
Bear in mind that, you will need new license keys after updating to the later version (after 8.0 version).
Note: You will see a version mismatch in some screenshots.
Download the required files Download the Upgrade Assessment Tool available at VMware Downloads. And also, proceed to download the Virtual appliance upgrade PAK file, that will be used later for the real upgrade:</description>

      <description>Prologue With the release of vSphere 7 at the beginning of this month, I decided to make a post about how to install vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) which is quite simple.
Which are the new features? Check this post from my friend Graham Barker to find out!
Let’s move on!
Proceed to download the «VMware vCenter Server 7.0.0» ISO file from my.vmware.com Mount the ISO file and execute the installer.exe file : Prerequisite: We need DNS if we want to deploy vCenter with an FQDN but if you don’t have it or you can’t for any reason, you can trick the installer and put the IP address as the hostname and it will work.</description>

      <description>Here I will explain a summary of days 1 and 2 (November 4th and 5th) of VMworld Europe 2019 from my perspective.
So, the first official day is on Monday (November 4th) where there aren’t many people like the next day (the second day, Tuesday 5th) but anyway there are many activities to do!
This time I was awarded a blogger pass, hence, I will have the honor to be with other bloggers at VMworld while enjoying some privileges like having a reserved seat in the general session, stay with other bloggers or join some special events.</description>

      <description>As the VCAP-DCV Design 2020 certification is going to be released (but the 3V0-624 exam is not scheduled to be retired yet) on Jan 1, 2020.
Recently I made another post about my experience with this exam where I failed, check it here.
For your information, at the moment the 3V0-624 is the current exam code for the VCAP-DCV 6.5 Design certification (Also named VCAP-DCV Design 2019), always check the code for the exam no matter which is the certification name.</description>

      <description>Recently I took the 3V0-624 exam (a.k.a. VMware Certified Advanced Professional 6.5 – Data Center Virtualization Design Exam) and I failed (266/500).
I took it on September, 4th (a month and a half ago) and as I was on holiday and now preparing things for VMworld Europe I won’t be able to study after the event.
I recognize, I study a bit in a rush. In just one month for someone who is daily tasks aren’t about architecture, it can be hard (or not).</description>

      <description>This is a quick post of an error I found sometimes while deploying a new vCenter server appliance with an embedded PSC on the vCSA 6.x installer.
The problem In my case, I was trying to install vCSA 6.5 without DNS (this is why the system name has an IP address and the DNS is itself). Also, notice that the network section is empty:
If you try to continue with the installation, it will show you an error:</description>

      <description>Let’s start with part 3 in the cloning virtual machines in vSphere series, I am going to talk about another type of clones, linked clones!
All articles regarding cloning virtual machines in vSphere series:
Part 1: Types of clone
Part 2: Full Clone
Part 4: Instant Clones (not published yet) As said in previous articles, this series is only focused on VMware vSphere hence, VMware Horizon View is not contemplated (Linked clones are commonly used in that product).</description>

      <description>I am going to talk about my experience at a local VMUG, in my case the VMUG from Barcelona (BCN). It was my first time at a local VMUG event and this is why I decided to share my thoughts about it.
VMUG – What is? As you probably know VMUG stands for VMware User Group. Basically, you will find an international community of people where they share their experiences and discuss things related to VMware and other technologies.</description>

      <description>Continuing with the cloning virtual machines in vSphere series, today I am going to write about the full clone, how it works and some useful information about it.
So, let’s talk about clones… but just full clones.
How does it work? As you probably know a full clone is an exact copy of a source VM, meaning that, everything from the parent VM is copied (VM settings, disks, files, etc.).</description>

      <description>Most of you already know how to clone virtual machines within vSphere, and I mean cloning from the vSphere Web client within vCenter but, beyond that, there are other types of clones you can use in vCenter like, Linked Clones or Instant Clones (aka Project Fargo/VMfork)
Due to the large content that can be discussed about each clone’s type, I decided to make a short series of posts talking about cloning VMs!</description>

      <description>Hi! I am going to talk about my VCAP6-DCV Deploy exam experience.
I thought about making a huge post about the VCAP6-DCV experience (resources, notes, etc.) but, I don’t want to overwhelm you know. Hence, I am going to make another post for that, hence this post will be shorter and more readable.
1st attempt (Java error at the beginning) At September, 21st I sat down to take my first attempt in a VCAP exam.</description>

So, what I did? First of all, I checked the guest OS and verified that it was up and running. So I was wondering how the guest OS seems correct but vSphere Web Client (I refreshed several times the browser) was showing no space in all disks and I verified in the Datastores that the .</description>

A quick post talking about a new external PSC in vSphere 6.0 environments.
As you may now the vCenter product is composed by the PSC (Platform Services Controller) and the vCenter component.

      <description>Today let’s talk about vSphere Network I/O Control (NIOC) version 3 (vSphere 6.0), it’s a feature in the vSphere Distributed Switch that allows you to control granularly the output/egress bandwidth from a VM network adapter level. Besides there are other useful options within NIOC capabilities, today, I will focus only in the network adapter bandwidth limit for VMs.
Prerequisites: Enable the feature in the dvSwitch (in our case the one with Data Network):Scenario:</description>

      <description>I am going to start talking about the exam VCP6-DCV from VMware. The main resource you should use is the VMware site: http://bit.ly/1PLshWR
There you can check a path to achieve VCP6-DCV (there is a newer version VCP6.5-DCV). I took path 1, as I wasn’t certified.
Later, I took one official training course, VMware vSphere: Install, Configure, Manage [V6].
Next, I passed the vSphere 6 Foundations Exam (2V0-620) months ago and finally I did VMware Certified Professional 6 – Data Center Virtualization Exam (2V0-621).</description>
