      <description>This is a &amp;ldquo;remake&amp;rdquo; from my previous guide and maybe I have missed something which is not properly updated.
VMworld 2022 Europe is one month away and I am excited because that means the first event that I am going to attend this year (after not being able to attend Kubecon in Valencia&amp;hellip;)
This is a remake of my previous guide with tips about transport, restaurants, places to go, etc.</description>

      <description>A few days ago VMware announced that VMworld will be online due to the current situation with COVID-19. Review the VMworld FAQs.
Therefore, as there will be only one big online event during the week of September 28, 2020.
So, why not attend a free mini-VMworld in less than a month?
That’s vForum Online!
vForum Online is a LIVE virtual event where you can access it directly from any device. Obviously there’s no travel required, so why not engage with more people and learn about new trends, features, and technologies?</description>

      <description>Here I will explain a summary of days 1 and 2 (November 4th and 5th) of VMworld Europe 2019 from my perspective.
So, the first official day is on Monday (November 4th) where there aren’t many people like the next day (the second day, Tuesday 5th) but anyway there are many activities to do!
This time I was awarded a blogger pass, hence, I will have the honor to be with other bloggers at VMworld while enjoying some privileges like having a reserved seat in the general session, stay with other bloggers or join some special events.</description>

General information This event will take place from the 4th (Monday) to 7th (Thursday) of November at Fira Gran Via in Barcelona, Spain.

      <description>I am going to talk about my experience at a local VMUG, in my case the VMUG from Barcelona (BCN). It was my first time at a local VMUG event and this is why I decided to share my thoughts about it.
VMUG – What is? As you probably know VMUG stands for VMware User Group. Basically, you will find an international community of people where they share their experiences and discuss things related to VMware and other technologies.</description>

      <description>To finish these posts about VMworld 2018 Europe, I am going to summarize day 3 and day 4 together as day 4 is usually the less busy of all of them (people usually leave in the morning).
On day 3 (Wednesday), I rest like 5-6 hours (pretty normal to me) after spending some part of the night at the Veeam Party. I made it to be at the enclosure at 8:30 AM because at 9:00 it will start the second general session.</description>

Before moving forward, I forgot to mention that I met in my first day a nice guy, Daniel Paluszek @dpaluszek, we had a great conversation and he should be known as the vCloud Director guy ;).

      <description>Let me talk to you about my experience on my first VMworld! This is a personal experience I want to share about Day 1 at VMworld 2018 Europe.
Introduction I live in Barcelona so, I am fortunate that I don’t need to travel to go to the VMworld Europe. The only thing is to commute by train between home and Fira Barcelona (where VMworld is established). It was Monday, November 5th, 2018.</description>
