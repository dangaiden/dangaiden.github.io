<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a hard exam even for the limited time you have (2h) and I learnt about other resources I usually don&rsquo;t use but overall it was great to know about them.</p>
<p>Remember you have a <strong>free retake</strong> when you order the exam so don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t make it in the first one but make sure to use your time wisely when taking it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all, next one is the CKAD which should be &ldquo;easier&rdquo; as per other reviews I have read.</p>
<p>More in the next post!</p>
