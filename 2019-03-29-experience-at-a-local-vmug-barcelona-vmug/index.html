<p><span style="">As you probably know<strong> VMUG</strong> stands for <strong>VM</strong>ware <strong>U</strong>ser <strong>G</strong>roup. Basically, you will find an international community of people where they share their experiences and discuss things related to VMware and other technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">At your local VMUG, you will find VMUG members that you can meet online or in person, sponsors. There you can find many passionate people about VMware and connect with them, so I highly recommend to attend to the VMUG events as it is a great experience to learn concepts or technologies and connect with a lot of people.</span></p>
<p><span style="">There are many communities around the world if you want to find your local VMUG go and register at <a href="https://www.vmug.com/"><a href="https://www.vmug.com/">https://www.vmug.com/</a></a></span></p>

<p><span style="">I’ve been involved in this local VMUG for a year approximately but, I never had the chance to attend any event.

<p><span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">In my case, I presented a session (in Spanish) about <strong>Clones in vSphere</strong> (I’ll do a post about presenting in the near future) on March, 15th.</span><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-701 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vmug_sidevision-1024x578.jpg" alt="vmug_present_aboutme" width="656" height="370" /></span></p>
