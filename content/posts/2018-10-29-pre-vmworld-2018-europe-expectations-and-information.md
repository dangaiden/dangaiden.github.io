<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">VMworld 2018 Europe is only a week away! And I wanted to explain you share expectations and information I found about. <strong>It will be my 1st time</strong>!</span>

### <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">VMworld Location</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">As you may know, VMworld Europe is located in Fira Barcelona between 5-8th of November. As it&#8217;s in Barcelona, I am able to assist without paying any trip (I live close to the city).<br /> </span>

<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">Main information</span>

  <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">A quick guide from VMware before going: </span><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vmworld/2018/07/vmworld-guide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-size: 14px;">https://blogs.vmware.com/vmworld/2018/07/vmworld-guide.html</span></a></span>
</p>

### <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">Events</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">At VMworld, there are a lot of events happening before, during and after. You can join them free or by invitation. Be quick to register as some events will close earlier&#8230;</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">All events (parties, meetings, etc.):<br /> <a href="http://www.vbrain.info/2018/10/09/vmworld-emea-2018-parties-gatherings-events-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.vbrain.info/2018/10/09/vmworld-emea-2018-parties-gatherings-events-and-more/</a><br /> <a href="http://www.running-system.com/vmworld-2018-barcelona-party-list/">http://www.running-system.com/vmworld-2018-barcelona-party-list/</a></span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">I will be attending vBreakfast: <a href="http://www.vbrain.info/2018/10/14/vmworld-emea-2018-vbreakfast-2018-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.vbrain.info/2018/10/14/vmworld-emea-2018-vbreakfast-2018-edition/</a></span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">Also, I&#8217;ll be at VMFest on Wednesday and maybe other parties but I can&#8217;t assure anything.</span>

### <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">Expectations</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">I am going every day except for Thursday that I&#8217;ll leave before 1 PM.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">My schedule is built with sessions, workshops, parties (just a couple) and obviously a couple of hours of free time, to network and do whatever I want (also relax, as it seems that can be exhausting). Remember that all sessions will be recorded so if you can&#8217;t attend it, you can watch it later.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">About the parties, I won&#8217;t be able to stay too late because I need to come back home and we have more days to enjoy VMworld.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">If you want to talk or something (like play some video games), you can find me on Twitter (I am really active). I&#8217;ll be open to everyone in the community!<br /> </span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">Even I know I am not a famous guy, (and don&#8217;t pretend to be it), talking with new people can be satisfying and it&#8217;s always great to meet someone new.  If you are shy you could try to engage someone on Twitter and let him/her know that you are there!</span>

 <span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">As it is my 1st time I can&#8217;t give any advice on this, you should check other blogs for that.<br /> </span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">P.S. I wanted to meet especially (among other people) Ariel (<a href="https://twitter.com/arielsanchezmor">@arielsanchezmora</a>) but it couldn&#8217;t be as he can&#8217;t assist.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">See you there and enjoy Barcelona!</span>
