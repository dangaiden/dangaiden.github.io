  * Site Recovery Manager (SRM) can be setup as Active-Passive or Active-Active
  * SRM does NOT perform replication.  It only manages the failover of VMs between sites
  * SRM needs to be used in conjunction with a replication software like vSphere Replication or array based replication
  * If array based replication is used then a Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) needs to be installed at each SRM site to communicate with the array
  * SRM can help create a Stretch Cluster and perform long distance vMotion between separate vCenter Servers
  * SRM and vCenter need to be running in both the protected and recovery sites
  * SRM uses Protection Groups to identify what VMs are being replicated
  * SRM uses Priority Groups to prioritize what VMs are recovered first
  * SRM IP customization is used to translate a VM’s subnet from the one used at the protected site to the one used at the recovery site
  * SRM license is purchased separately from vSphere or ESX
  * SRM license is per-VM
