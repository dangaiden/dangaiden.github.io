<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">Hi! I am going to talk about my <strong>VCAP6-DCV Deploy exam experience</strong>.</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">I thought about making a huge post about the VCAP6-DCV experience (resources, notes, etc.) but, I don&#8217;t want to overwhelm you know. Hence, I am going to make another post for that, hence this post will be shorter and more readable.</span>

### <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">1st attempt (Java error at the beginning)</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">At September, 21st I sat down to take my first attempt in a VCAP exam. I was confident because I was studying the previous 10 weeks approximately and I covered all the objectives.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">Well, my exam was scheduled at 10:00 AM, I sat down and my exam starts. The interface is exactly the same as the HOLs, so, if you familiarized with it, you will gain a lot of time!</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">The lab was deploying and the manual on the right side showed some information but as soon as the lab finishes to deploy&#8230;bum!</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">A Java error appeared:<strong> Java error: Unhandled Exception</strong>, then I pressed OK and my exam finishes itself!</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">I contacted the TA and she told me that my exam was finished, and I was like «What? In 2 minutes?». After spending some hours with Pearson VUE, the TA (Test Administrator) opened a case with Pearson VUE and I left the Test Center.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">I left with a feeling that this test center has serious issues, the TA didn&#8217;t know how to speak in English (I was taking it in Barcelona, Spain) and finally, I ended talking my self with Pearson VUE and explaining the problem. They couldn&#8217;t do anything as my exam was finished (it wasn&#8217;t my fault obviously)</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">A week later I received a voucher code for my crashed exam.</span>

### <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">2nd attempt (Manual stuck in loading)</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">This second attempt was scheduled at October, 5th. I rescheduled in another Test Center as I didn&#8217;t trust the TA for that Test Center.</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">The problem you face with the VCAP exams is that they are delivered in fewer Test Centers, therefore, there are  less available spots to take it. I found another Test Center here in Barcelona, so I scheduled there even I didn&#8217;t know that one.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">Well, my exam started at 10:00 am, the server&#8217;s console loaded correctly after the lab was deployed (nice!) but, <strong>the manual didn&#8217;t appear</strong>, there was only a grey window without content.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">After waiting for 5 minutes, I spoke with the TA, and he told me to wait another 5 minutes. So, as expected, the manual was stuck loading and even trying to stop and start the exam didn&#8217;t fix the problem.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">Hence, the TA contacts Pearson VUE and Pearson VUE fixed the problem this time! But what happened with all the time I lost in my exam? Well, the TA told me Pearson VUE would contact with VMware and the time will be added meanwhile I am taking it.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">At that time, the exam started again but I had a weird feeling about.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">In the exam, I finished writing down each question number and a brief description on the erasable board, in this manner, I could check quickly which questions I can take first and cross out which I have done.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">It was curious that at times, <strong>backspace and shift keys worked in Putty</strong>. Also, occasionally, during 5-10 minutes I experienced quite delay with the Web Client. I continued with the exam, contacted with the TA about the time but no response from Pearson VUE and time were running out&#8230;</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">The time isn&#8217;t going to be added, hence, I had to left like 4 or 5 empty questions because I didn&#8217;t have more time (I lost 30 minutes) and the exam finalizes automatically. I felt bad because of the 30 mins. would be nice to try other questions.<br /> </span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">After that, I spoke with the TA and he opened a case with Pearson VUE about the time lost. One hour later, I received my score report, 278/500 (almost got it!).</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">After a few days, Pearson VUE reviewed my case and, as I was close to passing the exam (remember that you need 300/500), I suppose they decided to give me another voucher code, so I felt good about the free re-schedule but bad for the score and the time lost.</span>

### <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">3rd attemp</span>t (Redeployed lab and final attempt)</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">Well, this is really a lie, because I «took» 2 exams in a row. Let me explain&#8230;</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">On October, 16th, my exam was scheduled at 10:00 AM, I studied a bit the previous night just to remember some things. My last attempt was 11 days ago and I was focused on other things so, it&#8217;s always good to brush up some concepts.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">Well, the exam started and the lab was deploying itself&#8230; then, it appeared a notification like «Query not found». This time the manual loaded correctly, but the pop-up appeared all the time, appearing and disappearing, and the console didn&#8217;t load as the error appears instead.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">Therefore, the TA (Test Administrator) contacted Pearson VUE and for my surprise, Pearson VUE this time could contact VMware quite fast. The TA told me that VMware was going to redeploy another lab (Now my time wasn&#8217;t wasted at all!) and I could try in 30 minutes.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">Finally, I tried again and it worked correctly, the <strong>manual and console loaded correctly</strong> so, I took the exam. The connection seemed a bit better so I can&#8217;t complain about. Also, the backspace and shift keys worked as in my previous exam, therefore, I took advantage of it.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">Now, I tried to answer all questions (I left 1 answer empty because I didn&#8217;t want to lose more time) and I finished my exam (well the lab finished and it closes automatically) with a good feeling.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">In 1 hour approximately I received the email and&#8230;a <strong>PASS</strong>! Couldn&#8217;t be happier! Finally, a full exam without issues made me <strong>pass the exam</strong>!</span>

### <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">Conclusion</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">I can do a recap of what I learned about my experience with that exam and all the issues I experienced:</span>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li>
    <span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">If you have any problem, contact your TA, don&#8217;t waste time to wait for the manual or console to load.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">Test if backspace and shift keys work! I was concerned that these keys were blocked but I was able to use it and avoid the On-Screen keyboard, maybe it can work for you.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Manage your time</strong>, manage your time. Everything you will read about this exam (or new ones) is about managing your time and I couldn&#8217;t agree more. </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">Use the <strong>erasable board</strong>! I used to write down each question number and a brief description, it helped me to know if I was running out of time and focus in the «easy» questions.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">Be <strong>aware of the dates</strong>, it was like a month ago since I scheduled the first attempt, so, if you are going to take it because your certification is expiring, be sure to schedule it in advance.</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">I am not going sugar coat the fact that I was happy with the exam&#8217;s delivery because I suffered many issues&#8230;but, finally, with some patience it was paid-off.</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">I hope this can be helpful for someone and I will write another post about the resources and how I prepared my self about this exam.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">Thanks for reading!</span>
