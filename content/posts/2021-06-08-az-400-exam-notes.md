<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Some months missing between my last update!</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">I must say I have been quite busy with the new position and the massive change that has impacted my previous knowledge but overall, I am pretty happy with it!</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Therefore, let&#8217;s move to the point! So I just want to share some notes of the AZ-400 exam which I recently passed and I hope that can be useful to someone.</span>

# 

# <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 32px;">Certification details</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">This exam (AZ-400) is the second one of the path to the specific Â«Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer ExpertÂ» certification:</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Last month I passed the Azure Administrator Associate exam (AZ-104) so I had the prerequisite already.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">You can<strong> check the objectives measured in detail</strong> for the exam <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3VP8d">here</a> but as a summary, this is what the official documentation states:</span>

# <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 32px;">Notes and resources for the exam</span>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li>
    <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Be sure to try <a href="https://azuredevopslabs.com">Azure DevOps lab</a> where you&#8217;ll be able to use Azure DevOps for free and with many guided Hands-on labs (https://github.com/microsoft/azuredevopslabs) â†’ <strong>MUST<br /> </strong></span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Study the majority of the Azure Products that can be related to any process within a pipeline, therefore, applications, web apps, secrets, repositories, VMs, etc.</span></span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Of course, I suggest you read and <strong>try Azure DevOps and the many of the integrations that can have with Github</strong> (remember that it&#8217;s owned by MS) within a pipeline.</span> <ul>
      <li>
        <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">This includes things like Azure boards, App Configuration, Azure feeds, Key Vault, Artifacts Credential Provider, etc.</span></span>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Monitoring tools within Azure</strong>&#8230;you know, the ones that you already know if you have taken the AZ-104, things like Application Map (within App Insights), Security Center, Data Explorer, App Configuration, Hosted agents, etc.</span></span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Knowledge about 3rd party products like Helm, Sonarqube, Terraform, Yeoman, and many other tools that analyze code or vulnerabilities will be helpful.</span></span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository">basics</a> is a must</strong>, knowing things like (init, Pull, push, commit, add, clone. etc.) but more Â«advancedÂ» things like (prune, gc, pull &#8211;rebase, stash).</span></span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Branching with Git (Main, Develop, Feature, etc) and deployment (Rolling, A/B, canary, blue/green, etc.) strategies will be key to understand as one of the main things used in pipelines.</span></span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Software testing as well: Smoke, flaky, unit, acceptance, etc.</span></span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Container basics with <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/">Docker</a></strong> (Dockerfiles, build/scan images process, etc.), AKS (Install, RBAC, configure), Azure Container instances, etc.</span>
  </li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">There can be more of course but I think you can get an idea of what can I think it can be useful and probably I missed many things I already know that I haven&#8217;t studied.</span>

# <span style="font-family: Nunito;"><span style="font-size: 32px;">Exam and opinion</span><br /> </span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">As for now, there aren&#8217;t simulations in the exam but be prepared to answer multi-choice, single, hot-area, and drag & drop questions plus case studies.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">There are about 60 questions in the exam and 150 minutes for non-native speakers (if I am not wrong) so plenty of time to answer each question.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Some questions are quite specific and not very related to general knowledge or even outdated which I don&#8217;t like it but that&#8217;s how certifications work in many cases.</span>

 <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Most of them are related to Azure, DevOps, and the integration with 3rd party applications so be sure to check them and don&#8217;t hesitate to make a list of <strong>third-party applications and the usage of them within different language</strong>s.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">I studied for a month or so but I do have a certain experience with Azure and I think a great knowledge of many of the processes, 3rd party tools (Jenkins, Sonarqube, Helm), and strategies used in pipelines within CI/CD. </span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Be sure to test and experiment with Azure DevOps as it is obvious that it will appear in the exam ðŸ™‚</span>

# <span style="font-size: 32px; font-family: Nunito;">Conclusion</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>I found it fair but not easy</strong> for someone who just got introduced to Azure Dev and has a general knowledge of the Â«DevOps worldÂ» (I hate to say it like this).</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">It requires a bit of experience with many of the Azure products, how are they correlated/integrated within a pipeline and many other tools.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">I hope this can be useful to anyone willing to take this but in my case, <strong>I did it so can you!</strong></span>
