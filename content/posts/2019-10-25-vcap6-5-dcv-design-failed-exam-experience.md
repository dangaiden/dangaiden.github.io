<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Recently I took the <a href="https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification/vcap6-5-dcv-design-exam.html"><span class="st">3V0-624</span></a> exam (a.k.a. VMware Certified Advanced Professional 6.5 – Data Center Virtualization Design Exam) and I failed (266/500).</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">I took it on September, 4th (a month and a half ago) and as I was on holiday and now preparing things for VMworld Europe I won&#8217;t be able to study after the event.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">I recognize, I study a bit in a rush. In just one month for someone who is daily tasks aren&#8217;t about architecture, it can be hard (or not). In my case, this rush was influenced due to leaving on vacation for more than 2 weeks. Then, I decided to give it a try before leaving but, the outcome wasn&#8217;t what someone would like!</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Let me share my experience in the exam, some thoughts, resources, and notes that maybe can help you.</span>

# <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 32px; color: #000000;">Know yourself</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">What I want to say in this section is knowing your limitations and experience against the exam. I am not going to do a comparison against the blueprint right now but, check the blueprint and be honest to yourself.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">This exam is called «Design» and that means having a broad knowledge on many areas (like networking, storage, computing, hardware, etc.), a different mindset than an engineer (the famous «holistic» view that architects have).</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">So, basically, check all the sections in the blueprint and match them against your knowledge. Are there too many gaps? Then, you probably need more experience and a lot of time to study (or both) but definitely, the experience becomes very handy for this exam.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">(I recommend you to check the blueprint from the <a href="https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification/vcap6-dcv-design-exam.html">VCAP6-DCV Design</a> which is quite better than the 6.5 version (in fact, it has the resources split into sections instead of giving you a list of 50+ resources like in the 6.5 version).</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">I am not an architect but I did some projects from the scratch (small ones) and participated in others that were normal (I don&#8217;t want to say big because it is subjective) as a technical reference so, I had some of the knowledge regarding how to approach a project</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Expect to gather the requirements, find «RRAC» (Requirements, Risks, Assumptions and Constraints) and also I had knowledge in DC architecture, vSphere (obviously) and other products from VMware (this is a VMware exam so don&#8217;t expect another thing!).</span>

# <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 32px; color: #000000;">Study Resources</span>

T<span style="font-size: 16px;">here are many resources that you can find on the internet:</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">The books I read:</span>

  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">VCAP5-DCD guide</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">IT Architect: Foundation in the Art of Infrastructure Design: A Practical Guide for IT Architects</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">VMware vSphere Design 2nd Edition</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Obviously I reviewed all the technical papers from the <a href="https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/certification/vmw-vcap65-dcv-design-3v0-624-guide.pdf">blueprint</a> and you should too (at least check if you understand the main concept).</span>

# <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 32px; color: #000000;">The exam</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">As the<a href="https://www.vmware.com/education-services/certification/vcap6-5-dcv-design-exam.html"> official webpage</a> states, there are <strong>60 questions and you have 135 minutes</strong> (2 hours and 15 minutes) to complete the exam. This is plenty of time for anyone I think.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">I read other experiences and almost anyone had a lot of time left in the clock before finishing the exam. When I took it, I reviewed the questions and there were almost 30 minutes.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Questions can be large so, maybe you want to read it a couple of times or even when you&#8217;re answering it.</span>

<div class="col-md-12">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4 -2">
      <div>
        <div class="columncontainer2 parsys">
          <div class="examscheduledetails section">
            <div>
              <div class="prep-exam-container">
                <p>
                  <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">The format of the exam is multiple-choice, matching and drag and drop. That means that all questions won&#8217;t have a single choice solution.</span>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Even I had time to finish the exam without looking at the clock too much, I failed with a score of 266 (passing score is 300 like many other VMware exams). That means that I need to review which were my weakest points, resolve my doubts and catch up with all I studied a couple of months ago.</span>

# <span style="font-family: Nunito;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 32px;">Notes</span><br /> </span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">As far as I know, this exam goes until <strong>ESXi 6.5 U1</strong> (which is the latest release before the blueprint came out).</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Review dependencies between all products and features within vSphere (especially the ones related to the RAMPS concept).</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">The conceptual, logical and physical design concepts must be mastered.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Review limitations on each feature (HA, DRS, FT, etc.) or product (vSAN, SRM, etc.).</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">The vBrownbag videos and books like the «VCAP5-DCD guide» can be very helpful even though are «older». About books. the «vSphere Design 2nd edition» along with the «IT Architect series: Foundation in the art of infrastructure design» will give you a general vision of all concepts that an architect must know.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Check the blueprint from the VCAP6-DCV Design</strong> as the objectives are the same as the 6.5 version but better explained and with references on each section.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">So, that&#8217;s all I wanted to say and I hope that even I didn&#8217;t pass in this first attempt, it can help other people willing to take it in the future.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Sometimes you have to fail better before succeed.</span>
