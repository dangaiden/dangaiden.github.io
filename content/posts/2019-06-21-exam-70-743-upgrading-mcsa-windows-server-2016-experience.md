<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">I will explain quickly my experience regarding the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-743.aspx">Exam 70-743, Upgrading Your Skills to MCSA: Windows Server 2016</a> exam from Microsoft I took last April.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">It&#8217;s been a while since I took an exam from Microsoft (</span>the latest<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"> was in 2013 I think) where you probably know that these kind of exams are multiple-choice or single-choice.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">Through my </span>career<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">, I saw a lot of people cheating with these exams by memorizing the questions you can find on the internet and finishing it in just 20 minutes.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">Despite I envied these persons because they weren&#8217;t putting the same effort as I did, in the </span>end<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">, this was translated in almost no knowledge about what they practiced nor familiar with all the features that Windows Server offers.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">So, I encourage you to <strong>study the materials and practice</strong> in order to learn and bring value to yourself if you want to use these technologies from Microsoft. </span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">The blueprint and webpage for this exam is the following one: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-743.aspx">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-743.aspx</a></span>

## 

&nbsp;

## <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">About the exam</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">In my case, although I am experienced with Windows Server this kind of upgrade exams, which consists in a 3 in 1 exam, can be scary for someone who&#8217;s new or </span>hasn&#8217;t<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"> touched many roles that Windows Server has.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">Even I installed almost all roles from Windows Server 2016 there are some of them that aren&#8217;t so common and you should practice it in a </span>homelab<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"> (best way to </span>stick<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"> in your mind).</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">There are around 60 questions (the quantity may differ) chosen from the following exams:</span>

  * <div class="CSPvNext inline">
      <div id="" class="row-fluid" data-cols="1" data-view1="1" data-view2="1" data-view3="1" data-view4="1"> 
      
      <div class="span bp0-col-1-1 bp1-col-1-1 bp2-col-1-1 bp3-col-1-1">
        <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-740.aspx">Exam 70-740: Installation, Storage, and Compute with Windows Server 2016</a></span>
      </div>
    </div></div> 

  * <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-741.aspx">Exam 70-741: Networking with Windows Server 2016</a></span>
  * <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-742.aspx">Exam 70-742: Identity with Windows Server 2016</a></span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Regarding the questions there is a mix of Drag and Drop, Radio buttons, Checkboxes, &#8230;you know, the usual ones in this kind of exams.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Important:</strong> Be aware that the feature «<strong>Nano Server</strong>» was removed/deprecated in Windows Server 2016 time ago, here is the official post from Microsoft: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/deprecated-features">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/deprecated-features</a></span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Also read the changes that this exam suffered, in the official change document that Microsoft provides (is in the blueprint): </span>[<span style="font-size: 16px;">https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE2IoQP</span>][1]

<span style="font-size: 16px;">So, even if you see a lot of information about <strong>Nano Server</strong> in guides or courses in my case I didn&#8217;t find any question in the exam related to it (as it was deprecated years ago).</span>

## 

&nbsp;

## <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">Resources and suggestions</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">As a <strong>resource</strong>, I mainly used this course from Pluralsight (not free): <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/upgrading-your-skills-to-mcsa-windows-server-2016-70-743">https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/upgrading-your-skills-to-mcsa-windows-server-2016-70-743</a></span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">There are a lot of videos there, I checked the ones I felt more insecure and practiced in the lab. Also, I do recommend that you <strong>use Powershell</strong> to install and configure everything you can and in this way, you will get used to it.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">As this is a 3 in 1 exam, the range of features and roles to know is huge, knowing a bit of everything will help you to pass but, without practice, you won&#8217;t get anywhere&#8230;</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Having experience helps a lot but if it&#8217;s not your case, <strong>focus </strong>on<strong> the roles and features you never used</strong> or are not used to use (ADFS, NPS, RRAS, Hyper-V, etc.).</span>

## 

&nbsp;

## <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">So&#8230;</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">To conclude, I can say it&#8217;s a fair exam and a bit challenging maybe but if you practice a lot with all the roles that Windows Server 2016 offers and know the differences from Windows Server 2012 R2.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Also, the most important I think&#8230;<strong>practice with Powershell</strong>. It won&#8217;t only help you with the exam also, in your future!</span>
