<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">Let me </span><span style="font-size: 14px;">talk</span> <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">to you about my experience on my first VMworld! This is a personal experience I want to share about <strong>Day 1 at VMworld 2018 Europe</strong>.</span>

### <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">Introduction</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">I live in Barcelona so, I am fortunate that I don&#8217;t need to travel to go to the VMworld Europe. The only thing is to commute by train between home and Fira Barcelona (where VMworld is established). </span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">It was Monday, November 5th, 2018. I woke up around 6 AM and took the train to arrive at 8 AM approximately.</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">This is how the entrance looked:</span><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-441" src="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/out-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="656" height="492" srcset="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/out-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/out-300x225.jpg 300w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/out-768x576.jpg 768w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/out-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/out-1568x1176.jpg 1568w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/out.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" />

### <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">Inside VMworld</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">I picked up my badge (using a QR code from the VMworld app) and headed to the VMvillage (the main place on this event). </span><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-439 size-large" src="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vmworld_hor-1024x624.jpg" alt="" width="656" height="400" srcset="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vmworld_hor-1024x624.jpg 1024w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vmworld_hor-300x183.jpg 300w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vmworld_hor-768x468.jpg 768w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vmworld_hor-1536x936.jpg 1536w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vmworld_hor-2048x1248.jpg 2048w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vmworld_hor-1568x955.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" />

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">After taking some pictures&#8230; I went to take a lab at the HOL Lounge, why? Because I wanted to try new labs, there are more slots available and I wanted to feel an experience like that at VMworld. Also, you learn some coins for the </span><span style="font-size: 14px;">VMware code ( <a href="http://vmwcc.com/">http://vmwcc.com/</a></span>)<span style="font-size: 14px;">.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">The first day is the calm day, I mean, the Solutions Exchange (where partners have their booths) is not opened and there are less interesting sessions (at least for my self) than other days. People usually are on TAM/Partners sessions or maybe they come on Tuesday.</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">I explored every enclosure&#8217;s corner and checked where were all Halls  (to not waste more time </span><span style="font-size: 14px;">the next day). There was food everywhere, from sandwiches to pastries and of course coffee, you could pick it on any lounge or at the VMvillage for free.<br /> </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">In the middle of the VMvillage, there was a Gaming Area with a  table tennis table, pinball machines, a giant table football and more things&#8230; my favourite part, the Arcade machines with a lot of games!<br /> </span>

<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-452" src="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arcademachines-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" width="599" height="449" srcset="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arcademachines-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arcademachines-300x225.jpeg 300w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arcademachines-768x576.jpeg 768w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arcademachines.jpeg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /> 

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">I was eager to meet some people I met on Twitter and of </span><span style="font-size: 14px;">course, I did it!</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">The first person I met was Graham Barker <a class="ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/VirtualG_UK"><span class="username u-dir" dir="ltr">@<b class="u-linkComplex-target">VirtualG_UK</b></span></a> an awesome guy who which I spent some time in the beginning, now I am thinking we didn&#8217;t take a selfie&#8230;</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">Also, I met Angelo Luciani <a href="http://twitter.com/AngeloLuciani"><strong>@AngeloLuciani</strong></a>, very kind guy! He takes selfies with a lot of people and always open to anyone, I chatted with him a bit and it was a pleasure.<br /> </span>

### <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">See you&#8230;tomorrow!</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">At the end of the day, I had some workshops to attend and couldn&#8217;t meet more people (obviously some of them are busy in the first day) but this only was the beginning of an awesome journey that will start at the next day, when the action begins.<br /> </span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">I returned home early as I had things to do and also on the next day vBreakfast will be awaiting me (at 7:00 AM). </span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">So, the first day was a great experience, is more dedicated for the partners but maybe you can network with people that on the next days will have no time (as probably you).<br /> </span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">In the next post, the second day, hasta la vista!</span>
