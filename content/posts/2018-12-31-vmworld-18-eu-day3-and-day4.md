<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">To finish these posts about VMworldÂ  2018 Europe, I am going to summarize day 3 and day 4 together as day 4 is usually the less busy of all of them (people usually leave in the morning</span>).</span>

<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-523 size-medium_large" src="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/9588_VMworld_Barcelona_Article-768x404.jpeg" alt="" width="656" height="345" srcset="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/9588_VMworld_Barcelona_Article-768x404.jpeg 768w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/9588_VMworld_Barcelona_Article-300x158.jpeg 300w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/9588_VMworld_Barcelona_Article.jpeg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /> 

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">On day 3 (Wednesday), I rest like 5-6 hours (pretty normal to me) after spending some part of the night at the Veeam Party. I made it to be at the enclosure at 8:30 AM because at 9:00 it will start the second general session.</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">I grabbed some coffee and go to the correspondent Hall, the same as the day before.</span>

## 2nd General Session

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">For me it was a weaker session than on the previous day but, I was great.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">Here you have a link to the Youtube video of the session: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W_8t6F_yY0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W_8t6F_yY0</a></span>

<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">In the previous post, I forgot to mention the <strong>VMware ESXi on a Raspberry PI</strong> as a prototype</span><span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">, that Pat and Ray showed us, really cool</span></span>**<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">. </span>**

## vCommunity, vStreetfighter and more

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">I must say that I had like 4 sessions scheduled on Wednesday and I only went to a couple of those. The most of the time I was hanging with people from the vCommunity and playing also I played some Street Fighter V in the gaming area. We have a group for that, check out #vstreetfighter for some tweets on Twitter and join us!</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">First, let me show us a couple of fights that I had against <a href="https://twitter.com/Dark_KnightUK">Bilal Ahmed</a> (I lost and I don&#8217;t how yet&#8230;). You can check here that Gregg Robertson offered a challenge against me at the gaming area.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px;">I can&#8217;t be happier to be able to meet these persons and more that I didn&#8217;t mention or couldn&#8217;t take a photo. When you are there, the time passes by quick and because of this, IÂ  didn&#8217;t go to some sessions (I knew that I could watch them later at home).</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px;">I enjoyed having dinner with Chris a couple of times, hanging a lot in the Solutions Exchange area or with Jorge de la Cruz to everywhere.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">Thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/virtspeaking">Virtual Speaking Podcast</a> for the Headphones, I was the lucky winner!</span>

### <span style="font-size: 28px;">VMparty</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px;">I was there about an hour or so and there I went with Jorge de la Cruz to have dinner in a nice restaurant.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px;">There was plenty of fast food: hamburgers, nachos, seafood, candy and more&#8230; so, if you want to feel full, you can&#8217;t go there!</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px;">Also, a Rolling Stones tribute band was there and they played really well!</span>

## The end

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span class="FullNameGroup">Well, I left around 5 PM and say goodbye to some people that still there.</span><br /> </span><small class="time"> </small><span style="font-size: 14px;">It only would have been better if <a href="https://twitter.com/GreggRobertson5">Gregg Robertson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arielsanchezmor">Ariel Sanchez</a> were been there.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 14px;">And that&#8217;s all! Last post of the year obviously because it&#8217;s the last day.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">P.S. : I forgot to mention I took a photo with someone&#8230; Rodney Mullen!</span><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-444 size-large" src="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dan_rodney-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="656" height="875" srcset="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dan_rodney-768x1024.jpeg 768w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dan_rodney-225x300.jpeg 225w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dan_rodney-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dan_rodney.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" />
