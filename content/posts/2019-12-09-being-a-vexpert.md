<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">Fr</span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">om November 25th to January 10th, you can apply to be a vExpert 2020 through many </span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">different paths and you must do it if you think you contributed to the VMware community.</span>

# <span style="font-family: Nunito; color: #000000; font-size: 32px;">What is a vExpert?</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">It&#8217;s an award that VMware gives to individuals who have contributed (a lot) to the VMware community.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Only the contributions over the past year are evaluated, therefore, it is a program that requires constant dedication every year by being an evangelist and advocacy of VMware products.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">vExpert is not a certification! It&#8217;s an award that is given to individuals and not companies so,<strong> companies must not claim </strong>that title.</span> </span>

# <span style="font-family: Nunito; color: #000000; font-size: 32px;">Why become one?</span>



<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">vExperts who participate in the program have access to exclusive benefits. One of the challenges that you will see is, the journey to be and to maintain it. As I will explain later, being active in the community (through different ways) is the key to become one!<br /> </span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">At VMworld there are some exclusive gifts, access and parties that are only accessible to vExperts but, <strong>interacting with the community will be always your best gift in my opinion</strong>.<br /> </span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">Here is a list of some of the benefits:</span>

  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Join the private Slack channel (which is quite active!).</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Permission to use the vExpert certificate and logo on your website, social media, etc.</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Private forums on communities.vmware.com.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">Private webinars with VMware partners as well as NFRs.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">Evaluation licenses (1 year period) for many VMware products for your home lab!</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Blogger early access program for vSphere and some other products.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">Your profile will be listed in a public vExpert online directory.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">Access to vExpert parties and exclusive gifts at both VMworld events.</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">Preferent seating at VMworld Keynotes.</span>

# <span style="font-family: Nunito; color: #000000; font-size: 32px;">How-to</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Being a VMware vExpert is not a sprint and it doesn&#8217;t consist of making the greatest amount of blog-posts about VMware.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>To become a VMware vExpert, you must be active in the community</strong>: This can be achieved by knowing and replying to people on Twitter, writing blog posts about VMware technologies, reply to the VMTN forums even if you don&#8217;t know the exact answer.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Assisting or presenting to VMUG events is one of the best things you can do, not just to know people, promote yourself and learn new things also because you participate in the community and let yourself know.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">To apply just do it <a href="https://vexpert.vmware.com/apply">here</a> and list all the contributions from this year (2019).</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">If you still have doubts, you can <a href="https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory/pro">reach</a> your local vExpert PRO, which will help you with your submission. I can help you if you need some guidance or need any advice, just reach me on <a href="https://twitter.com/DanGaiden">Twitter</a>!<br /> </span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Once you apply, your submission will be evaluated and once the applications are closed, the vExpert 2020 will be awarded.</span>

# <span style="font-family: Nunito; color: #000000; font-size: 32px;">Summary</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">By being part of the community and involving yourself more in evangelizing VMware products through posts, VMUG events/UserCons, VMTN forums, etc. you will have a high chance of being a vExpert.<br /> </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">Remember that in only will count the contributions from the previous year (2019 in this case) so, if you are not one know, don&#8217;t worry, apply if you think you contributed enough to the VMware community.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">You didn&#8217;t contribute enough or nothing this year? Set yourself a goal and make it happen for the next year!</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">For me, being a vExpert gave me, not just licenses, gifts, etc. but many new friends of the community and a better knowledge of VMware products and culture.</span>
