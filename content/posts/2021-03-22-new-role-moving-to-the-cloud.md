<span style="font-family: Nunito;">Finally, I am writing something here.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito;">It&#8217;s being almost 5 months since I wrote my last blog post and it happened so fast but my final project kept me quite busy between November &#8217;20 and January &#8217;21.</span>

<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1884 " src="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fallout-fallout-4-vault-boy-green-wallpaper-preview.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="326" srcset="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fallout-fallout-4-vault-boy-green-wallpaper-preview.jpg 728w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fallout-fallout-4-vault-boy-green-wallpaper-preview-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /> 

<span style="font-family: Nunito;">After finishing my bachelor&#8217;s degree final project in January, I&#8217;ve been enjoying some free time for myself and with that, I Â«forgotÂ» about writing (a.k.a. procrastination) but not anymore as I plan to start again writing as I did in the past.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito;"><em>More on that project and the bachelor&#8217;s degree in the next blog posts!</em></span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito;">Getting to the point&#8230; I am writing this because finally, after waiting for 5 months (internal arrangements) I am moving to another position! So I am changing the role but not the company.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito;">Therefore, since today, <strong>I&#8217;ll be a Â«Cloud SREÂ» within NTT</strong>.</span>

# <span style="font-family: Nunito;"><span style="font-size: 32px;">Cloud what?</span><br /> </span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito;">Wait&#8230;.what the hell is Â«Cloud SREÂ»? </span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito;">I know&#8230; it&#8217;s a weird name but it&#8217;s the official name for the position. Probably a better name would be Cloud Automation Engineer (or similar) as I am not going to work with developers in pipelines and helping them closely.</span>

<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1886" src="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vault_boysearch.png" alt="" width="253" height="253" srcset="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vault_boysearch.png 240w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vault_boysearch-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px" /> 

<span style="font-family: Nunito;">I&#8217;ll be working with technologies and tools like Git, Ansible, Terraform, Packer, and more. </span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito;">Containers and Kubernetes (very well known) are also on the menu but the biggest change for me will be the infrastructure. </span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito;">I&#8217;ll be working only with cloud providers, specifically GCP and Azure, for now, we will see later.</span>

# <span style="font-family: Nunito;"><span style="font-size: 32px;">Challenges ahead</span><br /> </span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito;"><img loading="lazy" class="" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/a3HHoUXvLyDDO/source.gif" width="394" height="345" /></span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito;">Well, it could sound just a mere position change but for me, it would be a huge one. </span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito;">From using VMware, Microsoft and some Linux technologies mainly in on-premises infrastructures to mainly Linux with Git, Ansible plus containers in the cloud will be a huge change (which I am eager to start!). </span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito;">So basically Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which is a more common thing these days and quite convenient for the cloud.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito;">This doesn&#8217;t mean I won&#8217;t be posting more VMware things but probably more container-ish, cloud (GCP and Azure), and probably Linux things as I will be learning a lot of them ðŸ™‚</span>

_**<span style="font-family: Nunito;">P.S. This change will have a massive impact on my Windows to Linux journey which I expect to write some of it shortly!</span>**_
