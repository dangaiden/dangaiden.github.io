<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Just a quick post about the vExpert sub-programs that have been announced recently.<br /> </span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Nunito;">In my case, yesterday I received this message:</span><span style="font-family: Nunito;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1588 size-full" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;" src="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Welcome-to-the-vExpert-PRO.png" alt="Welcome to the vExpert PRO" width="809" height="425" srcset="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Welcome-to-the-vExpert-PRO.png 809w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Welcome-to-the-vExpert-PRO-300x158.png 300w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Welcome-to-the-vExpert-PRO-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /></span></span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">This means that I&#8217;ve been selected to be a vExpert PRO!</span></strong></span>



&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Becoming a representative of your country/region and willingness to help others become aware of the vExpert program are the main functions of a vExpert PRO.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Nunito;">So, if you want to become a vExpert, start now and you can probably become one!<br /> </span><span style="font-family: Nunito;">I wrote a couple of months ago a post about it: <a href="http://www.itgaiden.com/being-a-vexpert/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Want to be a vExpert?</strong></span></a></span></span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">If you want to check your region vExpertPRO, just take a look at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory/pro">official directory</a></span>.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Since yesterday I can say that I am part of the vExpert PRO program. Also congratulations to others like me that made it and the ones who continue!<br /> </span>
