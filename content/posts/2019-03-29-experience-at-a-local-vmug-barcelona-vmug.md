<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">I am going to talk about my experience at a local VMUG, in my case the VMUG from Barcelona (BCN). It was my first time at a local VMUG event and this is why I decided to share my thoughts about it.</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-710 size-full" src="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vmug-bcn.png" alt="" width="572" height="453" srcset="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vmug-bcn.png 572w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vmug-bcn-300x238.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /></span>

### <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">VMUG &#8211; What is?</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">As you probably know<strong> VMUG</strong> stands for <strong>VM</strong>ware <strong>U</strong>ser <strong>G</strong>roup. Basically, you will find an international community of people where they share their experiences and discuss things related to VMware and other technologies.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">At your local VMUG, you will find VMUG members that you can meet online or in person, sponsors. There you can find many passionate people about VMware and connect with them, so I highly recommend to attend to the VMUG events as it is a great experience to learn concepts or technologies and connect with a lot of people.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">There are many communities around the world if you want to find your local VMUG go and register at <a href="https://www.vmug.com/">https://www.vmug.com/</a></span>

### <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">VMUG &#8211; Why attend?</span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">Because you won&#8217;t regret it!<br /> </span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">I didn&#8217;t imagine that the environment and people were so good, everyone is passioned about technology, mainly VMware things, and you can hear their stories and share experiences that both probably lived in your life.<br /> </span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic; font-size: 16px;">Hence, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re presenting or attending your local VMUG, the thing is to go there, <strong>meet people and learn about the sessions</strong>! You will find that a lot of people share some passion for VMware and technology so, don&#8217;t be shy to say hello and try to meet them.</span>

### <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">Presenting at a local VMUG</span><br /> </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">I&#8217;ve been involved in this local VMUG for a year approximately but, I never had the chance to attend any event. Since VMworld I didn&#8217;t hear anything about a new event so, I spoke with the VMUG forum about when would be a new event and finally, it ended with myself presenting my session.<br /> </span>

<span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">In my case, I presented a session (in Spanish) about <strong>Clones in vSphere</strong> (I&#8217;ll do a post about presenting in the near future) on March, 15th.</span><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-701 size-large" src="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vmug_sidevision-1024x578.jpg" alt="vmug_present_aboutme" width="656" height="370" /></span>

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Didact Gothic;">You didn&#8217;t expect something like my case, I was lucky to present at my first time in this event but, usually, it&#8217;s better to go there and meet the people before presenting and not in the other way.</span>

### <span style="font-family: Didact Gothic;">Final thoughts</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">I am glad that I finally was able to attend and meet a lot of VMUG members, you can learn a lot from people through their sessions and also make connections that will be valuable in the future.<br /> </span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">I would highly recommend attending and experience the passion of VMUG members and the knowledge that you can gather from them.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Also, I would like to acknowledge the VMUG leaders from the BCN VMUG for letting me present and the sponsors that make it possible.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">I hope to see everyone in the next event!</span>
