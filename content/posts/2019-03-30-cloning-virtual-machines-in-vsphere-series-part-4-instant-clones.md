## Instant clones

Since this post from William Lam <https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2018/04/new-instant-clone-architecture-in-vsphere-6-7-part-1.htm>, I discovered that technology and I found it amazing. Instant clone or VMFork (project that later on was delivered through a Fling) was created some years ago and was able since vSphere 6.0 (in Horizon View).

With the new release of vSphere 6.7 , VMware made it available using a public vSphere API and now we can use it with PowerCLI
