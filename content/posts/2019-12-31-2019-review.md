<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">I haven&#8217;t thought of doing this kind of review but reading some of them through the internet, it motivated me to do it.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Also by submitting to programs like <a href="https://wp.me/p98Ovg-lo">vExpert</a> from VMware, made me realize that I did many things this year that I forgot and were amazing.</span>



## **<span style="font-family: Nunito; color: #000000;">2019 Timeline</span>**

  * <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">January: </span></strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">Going to the gym to get healthier knees and finished exams from the university with good scores. Semester ends.<br /> </span></span>
  * <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">February: </span></strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">New semester (about my degree) and many things planned.<br /> </span></span>
  * <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">March: </span></strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">Earned a certification (MCSA 2016) and letting my self know more in the local VMUGs. I was awarded as a #vExpert for the first time!<br /> </span></span>
  * <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">April: </span></strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">Getting stronger and not feeling more pain in my knees after a long injury (previous year).<br /> </span></span>
  * <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">June: </span></strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">I took some university exams (all passed!) and then&#8230; time to enjoy the summer!</span></span>
  * <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">July: </span></strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">Enjoying the time when there is no semester<br /> </span></span>
  * <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">August: </span></strong><span style="font-family: Nunito;">Lots of sport, going to restaurants and more.<br /> Planning what to do in New York.</span></span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>September:</strong> I failed an exam which I knew I wasn&#8217;t prepared but <strong>I got married</strong> (eloped) in NY ðŸ™‚</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>October:</strong> <a href="http://tcwd.net/vblog/2019/10/27/blogtobertech-2019-heres-the-home-stretch/">#BlogtoberTech2019</a> = 5 blog posts!</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>November:</strong> The event <a href="https://www.vmworld.com/en/europe/index.html">VMworld 2019 Europe</a>. Tt was amazing to meet new people, older friends and interact with all of them. Also, I was able to record sessions with the <a href="https://vbrownbag.com/">vBrownbag</a> crew.<br /> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1E3RxceOOk">presented</a> a session at VMworld!</span></span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>December:</strong> Nothing to say here, basically, preparing the next year.</span>

## **<span style="font-family: Nunito; color: #000000;">Success</span>**

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">First, things I did and makes me happy that I achieved or earned:</span>

  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Personal:</strong> Eloped in New York for just 2 months and 3 weeks ago!</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Commitment:</strong> Continue with my degree by passing all subjects with a good score.</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Networking:</strong> Meet better or new people which made me realize that there are good friends or someone you can chat from time to time.</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Better writing:</strong> Although this year I wrote only 16 posts (I know isn&#8217;t too much), I think I write better and I didn&#8217;t let quantity overcame the quality.</span>



&nbsp;

## **<span style="font-family: Nunito; color: #000000;">Failure</span>**

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">Obviously not all things went well:</span>

  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">I wasn&#8217;t able to pass the VCAP6.5-DCV Design exam in October, you can check it <a href="https://wp.me/p98Ovg-js">here</a>.</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">For 4-6 weeks, I gained some weight because of time anxiety.</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">I am procrastinating more than I used to (probably because of anxiety?).</span>



&nbsp;

## **<span style="font-family: Nunito; color: #000000;">To work on</span>**

  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Procrastination:</strong> I tend to procrastinate at home when I have to do university assignments. Also, other personal projects tend to be massively delayed.</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Organization:</strong> I do like to organize what I am going to do every week but maybe I have to put more fun windows and realize that sometimes you need to play games, do nothing and don&#8217;t be worried about you could do instead of seizing that time <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(time anxiety ?)</strong></span>! </span>
  * <span style="font-family: Nunito;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Writing, hosting, and more:</strong> More blog posts for the next year, host people to record sessions with vBrownbag, and presenting more.</span><br /> </span>



&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">And that&#8217;s all! This will be the last post of the year (obviously) and although I was aiming to publish another different post that I am working on, I decided and wrote today this quick post in order to let you know that no one is perfect of course and there are bad and good news that people usually don&#8217;t talk about.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 20px;">See you!</span>
