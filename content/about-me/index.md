<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Nunito;">I do like videogames and sports (mainly cycling and padel). For gamers, there is a Discord page <a href="http://vgamers.gg/">http://vgamers.gg/</a> where you can register and play some videogames with people who share their love about virtualization and games.</span>

Specifically, we work in IT infrastructure and we help other people in the IT industry to be better at their jobs by learning about IT.</span>

<span style="font-family: Nunito; font-size: 16px;">I presented in some VMUGs like in the VMUG Barcelona and VMUG Madrid:</span>
